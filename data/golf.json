I had to go out and get it. To shoot 31, man, that feels great. I don't know what else to say. It just feels awesome.”</p><p class=\"body-longform mb-4 md:mb-5\"><b>2005 PGA Championship</b>&nbsp;– In a Monday finish due to poor weather conditions the previous day, he finished at 4 under at Baltusrol to beat Steve Elkington and Thomas Bjorn by one stroke … Birdied the 72nd hole from the greenside rough … Held a 3-shot lead after 36 holes and was tied with Davis Love III atop the 54-hole leaderboard … Said Mickelson: “It was a week where there were things didn't go perfectly the whole time. The first couple of days, the ball was going in the hole, but thereafter, it was not. Yet, I had to gut it out and just find a way to make some pars and find a way to make a couple birdies.”</p><p class=\"body-longform mb-4 md:mb-5\"><b>2006 Masters</b>&nbsp;– Won back-to-back majors by claiming his second Masters title … Shot 3-under in the final round to win by two strokes over Tim Clark … Moved to world No. 2, his highest career ranking … Said Mickelson: “The stress-free walk up 18 was incredible. I had been wanting that. I had actually been wanting like a 4- or 5-shot lead, but 3 was OK, too. It was a great feeling walking up there, knowing that I had the tournament in hand.”</p><p class=\"body-longform mb-4 md:mb-5\"><b>2010 Masters</b>&nbsp;– Won his third Masters by 3 strokes over Lee Westwood … Shot 67 in the final round to overtake Westwood, the third-round leader … It was an emotional victory after wife Amy’s battle with breast cancer the previous year, as well as his mother’s battle with cancer … &nbsp;Said Mickelson: “To have Amy and my kids here to share it with, I can't put into words. It just feels incredible, especially given what we've been through in the last year, to be able to share this kind of joy means a lot to us.”</p><p class=\"body-longform mb-4 md:mb-5\"><b>2013 Open Championship</b>&nbsp;– Won the Open for the first time in his 20th start in this major … Had recorded just two top-10 finishes in his previous 19 starts … Started the final round 5 strokes behind but shot 66 to overtake 54-hole leader Lee Westwood at Muirfield … Said Mickelson: “Just an amazing feeling winning this great championship. And to play probably the best round of my career and hit some of the best shots that I've ever hit. Certainly putt better than I've ever putted.”</p><p class=\"body-longform mb-4 md:mb-5\"><b>2021 PGA Championship</b>&nbsp;… Made major championship history by becoming the oldest major champion at age 50 … Shot a final-round 73 at Kiawah Island to finish at 6 under and beat Brooks Koepka and Louis Oosthuizen by 2 strokes. … Shared the 36-hole lead with Oosthuizen and led by 1 stroke after 54 holes … Said Mickelson: “Certainly one of the moments I'll cherish my entire life.

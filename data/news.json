        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Nigma Galaxy’s Ammar \"<strong>ATF</strong>\" Al-Assaf has become known as a player who engages opponents through all-chats, tipping, and voice lines. In the recent past, he has toned down such conduct in official games, although in ranked games, the level of emotional expressiveness continues to be high. While on Janne \"<strong>Gorgc</strong>\" Stefanovski's Twitch livestream recently, Sébastien \"<strong>Ceb</strong>\" Debs, who has worked closely with ATF in the past during his time at OG, explained that the player does not tip and all-chat out of frustration as many would believe. Ceb claimed that ATF is mostly laughing and has no hurtful intentions towards the other player. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Ceb says ATF is laughing when he all-chats and tips the opponents</h2><p>ATF focused too much on Remco \"<strong>Crystallis</strong>\" Arets' Bloodseeker during the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC) 2023 game between Team Secret and Nigma Galaxy, even sacrificing his life to obtain the kill at some points. </p><p>This ATF play came when Nigma was in the lead, well positioned to win, and Secret was in danger of getting relegated to Division II. While co-streaming with Ceb and Yazied \"<strong>YapzOr</strong>\" Jaradat, Gorgc wondered why ATF was causing mental damage to someone who was on the verge of demotion.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Ceb, however quickly intervened, claiming that ATF was only joking around. When players engage in such behavior, it is common for them to be enraged, but this was nearly never the case with ATF.</p><p><em>“But actually he takes the tipping and the all-chat and the smileys and the stuff very lightly. I know it’s usually known as flame or aggression but for him, most of the time, he does not mean bad yeah. You know what I mean? He's not angry when he does that. He’s actually laughing when he writes all-chat and smileys and stuff. Usually, people write and they are very angry. People assume him to be like that but honestly, 99% of the time, he’s not trolling but he’s just literally laughing at it… And sometimes, he’s upset of course.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p><em>“That’s good. Not a lot of people can take it like that,”</em> Gorgc said in response to Ceb.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>With the victory over Secret, Nigma ensured that it would not be demoted to Division II. The squad has begun to compete much better than it did at the start of the season and will play its final series versus Entity on 30th Jan 2023. Nigma, however, can not qualify for the Lima Major 2023.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#E7362B;border-left:10px solid #E7362B\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/kuroky-discusses-atfs-addition-to-nigma-galaxy-missing-ti-for-2-years\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">KuroKy Discusses ATF’s Addition to Nigma Galaxy &amp; Missing TI For 2 Years</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\">",

During the tournament, Scout noted that New State Mobile has a lot of former BGMI players. Following this, Scout expressed his belief that BGMI players have an advantage over those from New State Mobile. Scout went on to say that he thinks that if all professional players from BGMI were to move to New State Mobile, the skill level of the game would be extraordinary. “<em>No doubt, there are many good teams and players in New State Mobile, but I feel BGMI players have been playing for four years, they have four years of experience and skill set,”</em> he added.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/tUP4SqR20jQ?feature=share&amp;t=16293\">Scout opined that players</a> from New State Mobile possess decent skills but lack experience. He explained that many players from New State Mobile previously played PUBG Mobile and were very good at it, which he believed makes them better at New State Mobile as well. <em>“Almost every New State Mobile player used to play PUBG Mobile, and these PUBG Mobile players used to dominate in the game. So, automatically, PUBG Mobile players were better than New State Mobile players at some point.

He emphasized that the experience they gained from playing PUBG Mobile (BGMI) would be an advantage. <em>“I am not comparing, I am talking about the experience, which matters here. Most of the players here (SPS New State Mobile Open India) are playing the LAN for the first time,”</em> he added.</p><p>Scout stated that he is not commenting on the skill level of players but rather their experience. He added that he believes skill can be attained through practice, but experience depends on time. He goes on to suggest that players who have previously played PUBG Mobile have more experience and that this is something that cannot be denied.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-mobileesports\">",

The 3rd person Moshpit mode in Call of Duty MW2 was removed from Modern Warfare 2 on 26th January 2023, leaving fans baffled. The same mode was removed from Warzone 2.0 on 12th January. Fans are disappointed with this move by the developers and are already asking for it to come back, with some pointing out that they specifically bought MW2 to play the 3rd person Moshpit mode.&nbsp;</p><p>It is unclear as to why Activision removed the 3rd person mode from Modern Warfare 2 at the moment. Many fans are speculating that it could be due to a lack of players or because it splits the fanbase.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>What is 3rd person mode in Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2?</h2><p>In Modern Warfare 2, 3rd person mode was available in various modes featuring two teams of six players. Unlike the previous games, however, the camera was put in first-person view when aiming down sight regardless of the weapon used. In Warzone 2, the 3rd Person Mode was a playable mode that could only be played on the Trios modes.</p><p>While there is no confirmation on when the mode will be back again in the two games, it is possible that it could be rotated in and out of the game by the developers in an attempt to keep the game fresh and interesting. So fans can keep an eye out for 3rd person mode’s return when the next playlist drops or when Season 2 launches. Note that playlist updates usually roll out every Thursday.</p><p>Reddit user LeoSosa <ins><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareII/comments/10m5s36/third_person_moshpit/\">wrote</a></ins>, “<em>I can't stand the fact that they removed 3rd person from multiplayer. They literally sold the game advertising for the return of third-person gameplay and me and other people based our decision to buy it on that too. It was basically my main mode for me and my friends. This is a scam.</em>”</p><p>Another Redditor <ins><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareII/comments/10m5s36/comment/j62ry73/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">pointed out</a></ins> that it makes no sense to remove the mode since 3rd person players are more incentivized to buy operator skins since they can actually see their operators, and added that Infinity Ward has always cared about selling skins. They added, “<em>Also, 3rd person would definitely be more popular if they just gave us more game type and map options for it. Even in its limited form, it was the only playlist my friends and I have played since launch (and the only reason we bought the game in the first place).</em>”</p><p>The Redditor reasoned that removing 3rd person from the game is not the same as rotating out a random map or a game type but it is the equivalent of removing an entire game.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Players should note that you can still play third-person in private games.

It has disbarred him from registering and/or participating in activities or events of the federation “<em>including and not limited to national/international championships or tournaments and from participating in any tournaments/events/championships” </em>it organizes<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>NO_Chance, in his reply to the show cause notice, stated that all his statements are true and have been supported by evidence, while all the allegations leveled by the ESFI in its notice were “<em>baseless and have no legs to stand.</em>”</p><p>He further called upon the ESFI to share the approvals from the Government of India, which allowed and gave the right to ESFI to choose the Indian team for the esports events to be conducted in the&nbsp; Asian Games in 2023. “<em>From the information available on the public forum, it is clear that ESFI has not been recognized by the Government of India as the official body for Esports in India. It seems that ESFI is a self-styled esports body for India and is completely misleading players at large,</em>” he challenged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>NO_Chanc3 further stated that the ESFI’s show cause notice was baseless and meritless and that it was vindictive in nature, specifically targeting him for exposing “<em>ESFI’s illegal acts.</em>”</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Team Whoops, NO_Chanc3 and ESFI lock horns in 2022&nbsp;</h2><p>The Esports Federation of India (ESFI) and the medal-winning Dota 2 team, Team Whoops, and its captain NO_Chanc3 were at loggerheads over multiple instances throughout last year. Team Whoops was originally selected for the Asian Games 2022. However, after the postponement of the event, the same roster participated in the Commonwealth Games 2022 in Birmingham, England. It won the bronze medal at the Commonwealth Esports Championship (CEC) in 2022.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Following this, <ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/medal-winning-indian-dota-2-team-locks-horns-with-esfi\">Ejaz leveled multiple allegations</a></ins> against ESFI. He stated that ESFI was forcing the team to stick with the same medal-winning roster through multiple international events to prepare for the Asian Games. Ejaz also claimed that the federation asked the team to forfeit the regional qualifier for the Commonwealth Games 2022 due to a lack of funds and that it agreed to go forward only when the players said they could find sponsors on their own.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that the ESFI replied to AFK Gaming via a release through email in September 2022 where it refuted Ejaz’s claims about the roster changes and the sponsorship woes.&nbsp;</p><p>Team Whoops and the ESFI also had issues during the <ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/indias-dota-2-team-at-loggerheads-with-esfi-once-again\">Global Esports Games and its regional qualifiers</a></ins>. According to him, the team was given only a few hours notice to confirm its participation, the federation communicated only via emails without any other reminders, and the team was not given enough time to prepare the documents needed to submit to the Global Esports Federation.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>What did ESFI’s show cause notice say?</h2><p>The Esports Federation of India sent a notice to Ejaz on October 27th, accusing him of unsportsmanlike conduct and making <em>“false and defamatory statements”</em> against the federation on social media.</p><p>The ESFI outlined how it intended to send a team comprising of the best Indian players for the Asian Games in 2022 and recalled how the event was postponed to 2023. It added that it organized the National Open Qualifiers in April 2022 for the Asian Games 2022 and selected Team Whoops (consisting of five main players, Krish “<strong>Moon</strong>” Gupta, Abhishek “<strong>Abh1</strong>” Yadav, Ketan “<strong>Evil-Ash</strong>” Goyal, Moin “<strong>NO_Chanc3</strong>” Ejaz, Shubham “<strong>madness</strong>” Goli, and Darshan “<strong>A35</strong>” Bata, the substitute player) to play Dota 2.&nbsp;</p><p>After the postponement of the Asian Games, the ESFI noted that it prepared a list of global esports tournaments that Team Whoops could participate in to gain exposure and hone skills. Following this, Team Whoops was given the opportunity to participate in the Commonwealth Esports Championship (CEC) in August 2022 in Birmingham, England, where it clinched the bronze medal.&nbsp;</p><p>The federation noted that in June 2022, the team requested a roster change for the CEC, requesting that Krish “<strong>Moon</strong>” Gupta be replaced with Vishal “<strong>HBK</strong>” Vernekar and that it accepted the change even though it was not as per the NESC rules.</p><p>Further, it noted that NO_Chanc3 agreed to participate in the 14th World Esports Championship (WEC) with the same team including Vishal. Following this, Team Whoops traveled to the United Kingdom for the CEC and the ESFI noted that it covered the costs of air tickets and local travel, boarding, lodging, and meals for the entire Team Whoops. “<em>Additionally, we ensured that the visas for the whole Team Whoops and the passport for Mr. Ketan Goel were fast-tracked and approved within 7 days, which usually takes up to 2 months.</em>”&nbsp;</p><p>It added that it even reimbursed Team Whoops’ insurance and visa fees in good conscience though they were not a part of its expenses. The ESFI claimed in its show cause notice that the money was deposited to the players’ bank account by 29th September 2022 after they submitted bank account details. It should be noted that ESFI only reimbursed the visas and insurance expenses after the team made noise about this matter on social media.</p><p>The ESFI added that it was once again intimated about another roster change on 29th August 2022 and was informed that Krish Nitin Gupta, Darshan Bata, and Vishal Vernekar were not in a position to play for the upcoming 14th WEC. The ESFI alleged that Ejaz refused to participate in the event if his request was not considered and that it denied his request anyway.</p><p>It noted that it reached out to the next best Dota 2 team as per the National Open Qualifiers standings and asked the team to remain on standby given that Team Whoops was incomplete. ESFI further added that it received an email and a few WhatsApp messages from Shubham Goli on 26th August 2022 where he allegedly claimed that he and other members of Team Whoops “<em>were being bullied and strongarmed into quitting</em>.”&nbsp;</p><p>In a previous conversation with AFK Gaming, Moin Ejaz stated that the situation arose because he informed Goli that if the team's performance did not improve, he would be replaced with Krish Gupta in the active lineup, and would only be a part of the team as a substitute player for the IESF World Championship.&nbsp;Goli, who was understandably disappointed with this decision, confirmed to AFK Gaming that he had urged ESFI to host an Open Qualifier to allow him and other Indian Dota 2 players to compete for a spot in international tournaments such as the IESF World Championship 2022 and the Asian Games 2022. This disagreement could have been the bullying allegation that ESFI referred to in its show cause notice.</p><p>ESFI stated that it has always followed protocols and acted in accordance with the mandates and denied the allegations made by Moin Ejaz and claimed that he took to social media with the intent to defame and disparage the federation, causing irreparable harm to its reputation. ESFI also claimed that it had reached out to Ejaz to discuss his grievances in a meeting, but he did not show up for it.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>NO_Chanc3 has always strived to represent India in Dota 2 esports internationally and achieve success. He is one of the best Dota 2 players in the country and was the first Indian player to reach 7000 MMR. As a veteran esports player, he has competed in various international tournaments including the Asia Pacific Predator League 2022, multiple World Electronic Sports Games tournaments, World Cyber Games 2019 APAC Finals, PVP Esports Championship, and more.</p><p>Most notably, Team Whoops! which represented India in the Commonwealth Esports Championship 2022 was the only Indian team to bag a medal at the event. Led by NO_Chanc3, the Dota 2 team beat New Zealand 2-0 in a best-of-three series in the bronze medal playoff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In conversation with AFK Gaming, Moin \"<strong>NO_Chanc3</strong>\" Ejaz revealed his disappointment with this decision. He said, “<em>I was the one who put this team together for the Asian Games and we won the Indian qualifier. I raised the issue against ESFI about its unprofessionalism during the Commonwealth Games but instead of working on its mistake, it decided to ban me on baseless accusations.</em>”&nbsp;</p><p>NO_Chanc3 also added that he was reconsidering his future in the industry, “<em>I was very motivated to do something in esports, especially for my country, but all the drama with ESFI, the restrictions, and ego issues have made me lose all hope in the esports scene.</em>” He expressed his intent to play for an overseas team if given the opportunity but noted that he will continue playing casually and focus on something else to get into.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>In December 2022, the Indian government officially recognized esports as a part of multi-sports events. President Droupadi Murmu amended the rules and ordered India’s Department of Sports, which falls under the ambit of India’s Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, to act as the nodal agency for esports in India.</p><p>With the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports governing esports, it is yet to officially recognize ESFI as the esports entity that will choose Indian teams for international events like CWC and Asian Games. Given this, it is unclear how ESFI’s decision to suspend Ejaz will hold up.&nbsp;</p><p>AFK Gaming has reached out to ESFI for its statement on NO_Chanc3’s suspension.

In this interview, SkRossi spoke about his esports journey, Global Esports’ Valorant team dynamics, goals and aspirations going into VCT 2023 league, and more.<br></p><p>While talking about his goals and aspirations for VCT 2023, SkRossi emphasized the support he has received from fans over the years, noting that the Indian culture of protecting and defending one’s family is reflected in the way fans support their favorite players. <em>“All these years, the fans have believed in me, and no matter what, they have tried to defend me. Even if I’m on the wrong side, even if whatever happened, they have always had my back. It’s Indian culture,”</em> he said. He added that it is now his turn to give something back to the fans and make India proud on the global stage.<br></p><p>SkRossi’s main goal going into VCT 2023 is to establish an Indian esports team that other Indian players can look up to and be proud of. He acknowledged that Indian players and teams have traditionally worshiped foreign players and teams because Indian teams and players don’t have many achievements on the global stage. <em>“In India, it’s always like, even for me, we have always worshiped foreign idols and foreign teams. We never had “this is the Indian team we look up to” or “this is the Indian player we look up to.” There was nothing like that because we had no achievements in esports outside our country,”</em> he said.</p><p><br>SkRossi believes that he is in a position to change this perception and that the VCT 2023 franchise league is his moment to shine. <em>“I am in a position to change that, I have a backup, and I have good people around me to help me achieve that. So this is my moment, I need to do it, and I will try my best to give an Indian team, that Indian players look up to, an Indian player that Indian players or aspiring players look up to,”</em> he said.</p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <p>SkRossi also highlighted the need for a role model for Indian players, someone they can look up to and aspire to be like. He noted that while there are multiple talents from North America (NA), Europe (EU), and Southeast Asia (SEA), there is currently no one from India who has made a significant impact on the global stage. <em>“There are multiple talents from NA that people from NA look up to. There are multiple talents from the EU, and there are multiple talents from SEA, but there’s no one from India who has done anything great in the world such that people can say I need to become that guy. I want to give that,”</em> he said.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

Split Playoff formats also remain unchanged from 2022 — the winners of Spring Playoffs will represent LCS at the Mid-Season Invitational (MSI), and the top three finishers in the LCS Championship shall go to Worlds.</p><h3>Format</h3><ul><li><p>Ten teams will participate</p></li><li><p>Double Round Robin setup</p></li><li><p>Matches are best-of-one (BO1)</p></li><li><p>The top six teams qualify for playoffs</p><ul><li><p>The top four teams start in the upper bracket of playoffs</p></li><li><p>The fifth and sixth teams will start in the lower bracket</p></li></ul></li></ul></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>LCS 2023 Spring Split: Teams and standings</h2></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-data story-element-data-table\"><table class=\"story-element-table-0f6b867a-be12-4ba2-80a9-0fb8579e172d\"><thead><tr><th>Standings</th><th>Teams</th><th>Record (W-L)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>⁠Cloud9 (C9)</td><td>2 - 0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>⁠⁠Counter Logic Gaming (CLG)</td><td>2 - 0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>⁠⁠FlyQuest (FLY)</td><td>2 - 0</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>⁠⁠Team SoloMid (TSM)</td><td>2 - 0</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>⁠⁠100 Thieves (100T)</td><td>1 - 1</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>⁠⁠Evil Geniuses (EG)</td><td>1 - 1</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>⁠⁠Dignitas (DIG)</td><td>0 - 2</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>⁠⁠Golden Guardians (GG)</td><td>0 - 2</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>⁠⁠Immortals (IMT)</td><td>0 - 2</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>⁠⁠Team Liquid (TL)</td><td>0 - 2</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Schedule for LCS Spring Split 2023</h2><p>The LCS Spring Split 2023 is kicking off on 26th January 2023 and will feature intense League of Legends action.

Blacklist Rivalry went all in for an all-rounded draft, consisting of Templar Assassin, Tiny and Tidehunter while BOOM Esports went for an aggressive draft, picking up the duo of Drow Ranger and Nature’s Prophet.</p><p>Boom Esports had the better early game, with Saieful <strong>\"Fbz '</strong>' Ilham's Nature’s Prophet and Yopaj’s Primal Beast having a decent net worth advantage. However, as the game progressed Blacklist Rivalry were patiently waiting for an opportunity to turn things around.</p><p>Blacklist Rivalry’s moment came at the 36th minute mark, as they pushed into BOOM Esports’ base and picked off its core heroes who were unable to buy back into the fight.

Sinha did not disclose any further details, such as the name of the player, the organization that attempted poaching the player, or the esports title that the player competes in. He stated that if anyone wants to sign Global Esports’ players, they should reach out to him, and not the players. Sinha also stated that the player reached out to him after the poaching attempt.</p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Global Esports’ CEO expresses frustration over poaching attempt</strong></h2><p>In a recent Twitter thread, Sinha stated that the organization in question had claimed to the player that the actions were not considered <em>“poaching”</em> and it would do a formal <em>“buyout”</em> with Global Esports. Sinha called the organizations that engage in such behavior <em>“scums”</em> in the industry. He added, <em>“You know who you are, the world knows who you are.”</em> However, he did not make it clear who he was referring to.</p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <p>Sinha emphasized that he is not a vindictive person. Still, if his goals and focus are disrupted by such behavior, he will take action to reveal the <em>“shady BS”</em> that the organization is engaging in. He claimed that everyone in the Indian gaming community is trying to grow the ecosystem. Still, if an organization’s objective involves pulling the rest of the organization, players, and creators down, then it is going on a dark path and leading numerous young minds down the same road.<br></p><p>Sinha added that he had turned a blind eye to what the same organization has done multiple times in the past because he was busy focusing on his own work.</p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <p>He explained that the intent of the Twitter thread was to let the organization know that it was not untouchable. He added that what the organization thought was <em>“under the table”</em> was not actually <em>“under the table.”</em> He added that everyone knew and laughed about it. However, he did not clarify what he meant by <em>“under the table.”</em><br></p><p>Sinha accused the same organization of spreading toxicity and hate and encouraging players and creators to ignore their contracts and agreements. He also referenced past controversies that seem to originate from the same organizations and suggested that their actions are detrimental to the growth of the ecosystem as a whole.<br></p><p>Sinha suggested that management of the organization must undergo training in human resources, public relations, and media training in order for the ecosystem to truly grow.<br></p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <p>Sinha also criticized the organization’s management for avoiding rules and regulations. Sinha stated that he would rather be known as <em>an “apology minister”</em> and be known for being the person who says sorry rather than be associated with the negative actions of this organization. Sinha also warned that the truth will always come out and that those who engage in this behavior will eventually face the consequences.</p> <p>Despite previously choosing to stay away from the drama, Sinha believed that the actions of the organization have reached a breaking point and can no longer be ignored. Sinha highlighted that the organization is destroying itself through such activities. He emphasized that he did not name any names in his statement but that it was clear to everyone in the community who the person was and which organization he was referring to in his Twitter thread.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Responding to the reply by Velocity Gaming’s owner Manoj “<strong>Sentinel</strong>” Kashyap, on the tweet, Sinha claimed that the same discussion had been going on internally between them for months. He added that it was time to stand up against this organization.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

It was more of an adjustment on drafting to my players’ strength. The old guard, Timado and Bryle also had to adjust their playstyle to adapt with the newcomers. I think overall, I think I found the winning recipe to make the team work. ”</em></p><p>He then went on to explain his newly found responsibilities as a coach, however he noted that his duties are almost identical to his time as a captain. “It’s not that hard. Because for the past two years, I used to watch replays, do some math on drafting and stuff, and do all of that in parallel with the game. I played a lot of games, trying to set a good example for my team.”</p><p>Additionally, he also noted that his health issues became a primary reason behind his transition. However, he said that he enjoyed coaching the new generation of players. <em>“It was taking a toll on my health and my back was hurting, even though I warmed up a lot. I realized I couldn't do that for another year. But now I'm a coach, so I don't have to compete and train my laning a lot. It's easier to coach.

In spite of the fact that EU is inevitably harder, more stressful, and more challenging, the player noted that there are no spikes in stress here because all games are consistently challenging. </p><p>However, when he played against Evil Geniuses with Quincy Crew in NA, all his attention, effort, and time were allocated to that series, and no other game was considered as important, something Quinn does not enjoy. </p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p><em>“I mean, it’s funny. I actually thought it would be more stressful coming to Europe because every match is hard and difficult, there aren’t like - pushover matches but I have felt the inverse that it’s less stressful because it’s more consistent. Whereas in NA, it’s like - you can win a sleep for four of the games and it’s just this mounting pressure - you are going to play EG at the end of the season, it’s the only match that matters whereas, in Europe, it’s incremental stress which is just nicer for me honestly. So, I have just enjoyed playing actual opponents, like every match, as opposed to just one or two.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>As observed in the DPC during the last two years, most of the hyped series are scheduled at the end. This is done to build excitement because these teams often win all of their games, and the series becomes extremely crucial in terms of Major qualification.</p><p>Furthermore, Quinn stated that he is seeing a favorable difference when playing in the EU while also explaining why the region is as competitive as everyone believes. </p><p><em>“Yeah, for sure. I mean there’s a reason I think this region is so competitive, I mean this has a large player pool but also there are so many good players so you are forced to keep grinding or keep getting better or you are going to get overtaken by some Into The Breach who has been grinding and is super hungry. If you are not on the top of your game, you are going to get trampled.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Gaimin Gladiators has one series left in the DPC WEU 2023 Tour 1: Division I, which will be against Tundra Esports on 27th Jan 2023. A win guarantees a berth at the Lima Major 2023, while a defeat may force the team to compete in the grueling tiebreakers to qualify for the season's first Major.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#E7362B;border-left:10px solid #E7362B\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/cr1t-reveals-it-is-more-fun-to-play-in-sea-compared-to-eu\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cr1t- Reveals It Is More Fun to Play in SEA Compared to EU</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\">",

Sinha claimed that if the game was going to come back, it would have already returned. According to Sinha, Krafton investing ₹1 Crore INR in Snapdragon Pro Series (SPS) New State Mobile Open India <em>“should be telling enough.” </em>Additionally, Sinha stated that it is purely misleading and detrimental to the ecosystem for everyone to wait for the game’s return.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-mobileesports\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Global Esports CEO does not believe BGMI will return&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Due to national security concerns, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) banned PUBG Mobile under section 69A of the I.T. Act 2000 in September 2020 in the country. The ministry stated that the game was prejudicial to the sovereignty, integrity, defense of India, and public order. With no hopes of PUBG Mobile returning, Krafton introduced an Indian variant of the game titled BGMI. This game quickly filled the void that PUBG Mobile left in the Indian gaming audience, with its absence starting in July 2021. However, the government of India went ahead and suspended BGMI as well under the same law one year after its launch in July 2022.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a recent Twitter thread, Sinha highlighted that PUBG Mobile was available for 30 months and has been banned for over 29 months. On the other hand, BGMI was available for 12 months and has been suspended for six months.</p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <p>Sinha added that he believed the game would not return, and the silence from the publisher and the government is clear evidence of it.

However, it does not field a roster in a few popular esports titles, like Valorant and Pokemon Unite. Although it signed a Valorant roster in December 2020, it was disbanded soon later.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a recent livestream, a viewer asked GHATAK if GodLike Esports has planned to sign rosters in Valorant and Pokemon Unite. Responding to this, GHATAK stated that the organization has planned to field rosters in all esports titles that have the potential to grow in India. <em>“I am telling you one thing, out of all the esports titles we have, we will sign teams for all those titles which have potential to grow in India, are already growing, and have chances of growth in the future. So, there will be a few announcements in the future,”</em> GHATAK said.&nbsp;<br></p><p>GHATAK explained that the organizations could not randomly sign players and needed to build a winning lineup. He added that signing a roster is a time-consuming process. <em>“The important thing is we cannot just sign anyone randomly just for the sake of it, we have to make a good lineup. We also need to have a winning lineup that has the potential. So, it takes a lot of time to find and scout players,”</em> he said.&nbsp;</p><p><br>In June 2022, GodLike Esports signed TSM India’s former player Arjun “<strong>SHADOW</strong>” Mandhalkar, which turned out as a controversial transfer. TSM India alleged GodLike Esports of poaching SHADOW. Thus, it created a negative image of GodLike Esports, in terms of poaching. GHATAK noted this and stated that the organization adheres to all contracts and formalities while signing players. <em>“Many have created a negative image of the members of our organization, that we poach players and all. Such things don’t happen in the industry, it’s common sense. Players go where they want to. There are contracts and formalities that we need to adhere to. We follow those things, it’s a simple thing,”</em> he said.</p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <p>Being one of the most prominent esports organizations in India, signing a roster in an esports title will be beneficial not only for the organization but also for the esports scene of that title.

The roster's sudden transfer from Enigma Gaming to Orangutan Gaming raised a bunch of questions in the Indian Valorant community. To address these questions, the team’s in-game leader, Antidote, recently went live on his YouTube channel to address these questions and clear the air around the matter.<br></p><p>Antidote revealed that Enigma Gaming gave players an early deadline to re-sign their contract. This decision would allow Enigma Gaming to plan ahead and ensure that they have a full roster of players for the upcoming season and avoid any potential issues. If players were to wait until the last moment to re-sign their contracts, it would have left Enigma Gaming scrambling to find replacements at the last minute. <em>\"If we could not sign the contract at the last moment, the organization would have struggled to find players for the team,\"</em> he said.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn't the ideal scenario for the players. With three months remaining on their contracts, players felt it was too early to commit to an extension. <em>\"The Organization asked us to re-sign the contract three months before its end date if we wanted to continue. However, as players, we thought it was too early to extend the contract. In those three months, we had two LAN events: Esportz.in and GXR India Invitational, and one online event: GXR India Invitational Qualifiers. So we thought it wasn't the right time to extend the contract,</em>\" he added.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>\"We all are professionals, and we all have expectations in terms of salary or paycheck. For that, player evaluation is necessary,\"</em> Antidote said. Following this, he explained that the team's performance in the said tournaments would have affected their paycheck. <em>\"At that time, we thought we should finish the events first. For example, if we had become Esportz LAN champions, won GXR, or performed better, our player value would have increased. So when we extend the contract after that, our base salary would have increased. However, if we had played poorly in Esportz LAN or GXR, our value would have decreased. So we were ready to take that risk,\"</em> he added.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Antidote again stressed that the decision was mutual and added, \"<em>The scenario neither worked for Enigma Gaming nor us; that was the only reason.\"</em></p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <p>Antidote also spoke about the support that the team received from ENigma Gaming during its early days. He acknowledged that when the team was established, it was not performing well and that he himself was struggling with the in-game leader role. Despite these early teething problems, Enigma Gaming continued to support and believe in the team, which allowed it to grow and develop into one of the most competitive lineups in Indian Valorant.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

Global Esports’ former analyst and coach, Malav “<strong>Rexdreams</strong>” Popat, recently stated that it was <em>“unfortunate”</em> to see organizations prioritizing <em>“imports”</em> over <em>“developing/finding talent in the region.”</em></p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <p>Following this, multiple prominent stakeholders in the Indian esports industry, including Global Esports’ Ganesh “<strong>SkRossi</strong>” Gangadhar, S8UL Esports’ manager Siddhant “<strong>Sid</strong>” Joshi, Orangutan Gaming’s Head of Esports Vinay “<strong>Hades</strong>” Rao and Velocity Gaming’s founder Manoj “<strong>Sentinel</strong>” Kashyap spoke about the matter and explained why organizations may turn their heads toward foreign players instead of exploring the local talent.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Hades believes that most Indian players are lazy</strong></h2><p>Vinay “<strong>Hades</strong>” Rao, head of esports at Orangutan Gaming, stated that he believes 90% of Indian players are <em>“lazy and just want to make money.”</em> He suggested that importing players from other countries can help maximize the chances of the remaining 10% of dedicated players to excel and also motivate non-professional players to strive to become one of them.</p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <p>However, Rexdreams suggested an alternative approach of focusing on signing the 10% of Indian players that are dedicated and motivated instead of importing players to encourage the other 90% to perform well, and will be a cheaper and more effective solution. Hades replied that other esports organizations have already signed that 10% of players and the remaining are yet to prove themselves.<br></p><p>Popular Indian Valorant star SkRossi also shared his thoughts on the topic by raising concerns about the decision to sign lazy players by offering them large contracts. He suggested that the investment would be better utilized if it were directed toward average players who would put in the effort and hard work.</p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Sid hopes signing foreign players will force Indian players to work harder</strong></h2><p>Indian esports veteran Sid stated that very few Indian players put in the same level of effort as foreign players and that esports organizations, whose primary focus is esports, must prioritize winning and if they have the resources, signing foreign players will always be a better option.&nbsp;</p> <p>In response to Sid, Rexdreams pointed out that the investment in imports has not worked out well for Indian esports organizations, except for a few successful cases. He questioned the decision of organizations to pay higher salaries and go through logistical issues for signing foreign players when they are not getting the desired results.</p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <p>Sid replied that this <em>“gamble”</em> is still worth it if the organization can afford it. He also highlighted that the real problem lies in some of the unsuccessful players from the Indian Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) scene, who are still gatekeeping and taking up spots in some of the Indian Valorant teams, despite their lack of motivation. He suggested removing these players would open up opportunities for more talented homegrown players to shine. Sid also hopes that one day, foreign players will completely dominate the Indian esports scene, as it will serve as a wake-up call for Indian players to work harder.&nbsp;</p><p><br>He acknowledged that in the last decade of Indian esports history, very few players had made an international name for themselves, with only a few exceptions, such as Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) talents and <ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/global-esports-coach-bigtime-skrossi-will-prove-the-haters-wrong-in-brazil\">Global Esports’ star Valorant player Ganesh “</a></ins><strong><ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/global-esports-coach-bigtime-skrossi-will-prove-the-haters-wrong-in-brazil\">SkRossi</a></ins></strong><ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/global-esports-coach-bigtime-skrossi-will-prove-the-haters-wrong-in-brazil\">” Gangadhar</a></ins>.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>VLT founder highlights the skill gap between Indian and Southeast Asian players</strong></h2><p>Sentinel suggested that Indian players were far behind in skill level compared to Southeast Asian players and that the skill gap between them could not be easily bridged. He emphasized that this required a significant amount of hard work, which the majority of Indian players were not willing to put in. He also noted that very few players in India were willing to put in the effort required to reach the level of their Southeast Asian counterparts.</p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <p>Rexdreams acknowledged that a skill gap does exist, but he stated that it could be easily bridged through the collective efforts of players, coaches, and analysts.

The team’s position four player Tommy \"<strong>Taiga</strong>\" Le discussed the team's current playstyle after OG's most recent series win over Entity in the league. Without giving away too much, he explained that the team strives to have stable lanes, but if results don't go as planned, their players have the flexibility to adjust later.

Then, he focused on the team's flexibility, particularly its cores.  </p><p><em>“Basically, a lot of times, we want to have stable lanes, right?

Our last game of the season will be against Spirit. We'll see, it will be an interesting one. I hope Gleb [depressed kid] qualifies for the Major, I truly believe in him. Nemiga is just like Vega, which I played with in the past. Good performance at the TI qualifier, but after that, they shouldn't continue together. That's my opinion.”</em></p><p>BetBoom Team are currently undefeated in the EEU DPC with five consecutive wins, with another victory essentially putting the team into direct qualification for the upcoming Lima Major in Peru. BetBoom Team’s next scheduled opponents will be Nemiga Gaming on 26th January, who are currently bottom of the standings with four straight losses.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\">",

Dehya, who has been a part of previous Archon quests is finally making her entry to the game as a playable 5-star Pyro claymore user. The other character debuting in 3.4 is Mika, who is part of Eula’s reconnaissance squad.&nbsp;</p><p>We saw Mika before during the Windblume festival and he will join the playable roster as a 4-star Cryo character designed to support Physical units. Here is a closer look at Dehya, who is the first 5-star Pyro character since Yoimiya who released back in 2021. All information available about Dehya is based on the current <ins><a href=\"https://ambr.top/en/archive/avatar/10000079/dehya?mode=ascension\">Genshin Impact Patch 3.5 leaks</a></ins> and Dehya’s abilities are subject to change as Hoyoverse continues to balance the character ahead of her launch. Players should wait for the official 3.5 livestream which will take place in February for an official confirmation of the leaks.&nbsp;</p><h2>Genshin Impact 3.5 Leaks - Dehya Character Overview and Skills</h2><p>Dehya is designed to be a Pyro DPS with sub-DPS / off-field capabilities. Her Skill (E) can apply Pyro even when she is not on the field while her Ultimate allows her to deal rapid Pyro damage using her fists. Here is a breakdown of her talents:&nbsp;</p><h3>E. Molten Inferno (Skill)&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>Indomitable Flame</strong></p><p>This skill will be unleashed should there be no Fiery Sanctum created by Dehya hersslf present at the time. Deals AoE Pyro DMG, and creates a field known as Fiery Sanctum.</p><p><strong>Ranging Flame</strong></p><p>This skill will be unleashed should a Fiery Sanctum field created by Dehya herself already exist.</p><p>Dehya will perform a leaping attack, dealing AoE Pyro DMG before recreating a Fiery Sanctum field at her new position. A Fiery Sanctum field created this way will inherit the original duration of the previous field. Only 1 Ranging Flame can be used throughout a single Fiery Sanctum field's duration.</p><p><strong>Fiery Sanctum</strong></p><p>When an opponent within a Fiery Sanctum field takes DMG, the field will unleash a coordinated attack, dealing AoE Pyro DMG to them. This effect can be triggered once every 2.5s.</p><p>Active characters within this field have their resistance to interruption increased, and when such characters take DMG, a portion of that damage will be mitigated and flow into Redmane's Blood. Dehya will then take this DMG over 10s. When the mitigated DMG stored by Redmane's Blood reaches or goes over a certain percentage of Dehya's Max HP, she will stop mitigating DMG in this way. Only 1 Fiery Sanctum created by Dehya herself can exist at the same time.</p><h3>Q. Lioness’ Bite (Ultimate)&nbsp;</h3><p>Unleashing her burning anger and casting her blade aside like an inconvenience, Dehya enters the Blazing Lioness state and gains resistance to interruption.</p><p>In this state, Dehya will automatically and continuously unleash the Flame-Mane's Fists, dealing Pyro DMG, and when its duration ends, she will unleash an Incineration Drive kick, dealing AoE Pyro DMG.</p><p>In this state, her Normal Attacks will be replaced by Roaring Barrage. Unleashing Roaring Barrage within 0.4 after each Flame-Mane's Fist strike will increase the trigger speed of the next Flame-Mane's Fist strike.</p><p>If a Fiery Sanctum field created by Dehya's own Elemental Skill, Molten Inferno, exists when this ability is unleashed, Dehya will retrieve it, and then create another field once Blazing Lioness' duration expires. This field will then take on the retrieved field's duration at the moment of its retrieval.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Genshin Impact 3.5 Leaks - Dehya Constellations&nbsp;</h2><p>Here is a summarized version of all the Constellations for Dehya.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Constellation 1 - The Flame Incandescent</strong></p><p>Dehya's Max HP is increased by 20%, and she deals bonus DMG based on her Max HP when using the following attacks:</p><p>Molten Inferno's DMG will be increased by 1% of her Max HP. The Lioness' Bite's DMG will be increased by 2% of her Max HP.</p><p><strong>Constellation 2 - The Sand-Blades Glittering</strong></p><p>When Dehya uses Molten Inferno: Ranging Flame, the duration of the recreated Fiery Sanctum field will be increased&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Constellation 3 - A Rage Swift as Fire</strong></p><p>Increases the Level of The Lioness' Bite by 3.

He added that many other regions around the world have already begun participating in the league and have progressed to the advanced stages of the league. Due to this, the organization could not give any commitments to foreign players as it was unable to commit to the league itself.

Despite having lost only one series against Team Liquid earlier in the tour, Tundra Esports is still on course to earning itself a direct qualification for the Lima Major.</p><p>During the interview, skiter mainly talked about the Tundra's latest opponent as well as the team’s scrim partners during the current competitive season.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Skiter has faith in Puppey’s ability to make Team Secret great again</h2><p>During the post match interview, Tundra Esports’ skiter was asked by the panel about the team’s latest opponent, Team Secret. Tundra defeating Secret has led to the latter suffering its fifth consecutive loss in the WEU DPC. He started off by saying that despite Secret’s bad form, the team tends to perform well when it matters most. “<em>I mean it’s sad to see fellow TI finalists doing bad in the DPC. But if you guys remember, the team did not do well during the last DPC season but they improved during the Regional &amp; Last Chance Qualifiers and they just started to click together.”</em> he said.</p><p>He also noted that he has faith in Team Secret’s captain Clement <strong>\"Puppey\"</strong> Ivanov’s abilities to get the team back on track as the season progresses. <em>“Who knows? I mean, it’s Puppey’s [team] right. He has been to every TI (The International) and he had great success with the team. I’m sure he’ll get it fixed by the time TI comes around and we’ll see him there.”</em> he added.</p><p>Skiter also spoke about how the team practiced scrims against Eastern European teams like BetBoom Team and Team Spirit, as he revealed that Tundra Esports tends to not scrim with teams within WEU to avoid giving out advantages.</p><p><em>“I mean, we always keep an eye out for Team Spirit since they have always been our scrim partners ever since the roster was established.

Arteezy mentioned that his first choice was recently retired Team Liquid carry Lasse \"MATUMBAMAN\" Urpalainen. <em>“It used to be Matu, I think. I don’t know who it is now.

So that usually keeps us in check. So we usually keep our heads down and work on improving ourselves. In terms of practicing with EU teams, I think there are a lot of differences between meta heroes in NA and EU. Like when we scrim against NA, South America (SA) or even EU, every region has a difference in terms on how they lane.

Yap \"<strong>xNova</strong>\" Jian Wei, the position five player for BOOM, was interviewed by Epulze following the team's win where he discussed the difficulties the team is facing after winning just one series in five. According to xNova, there are issues with the overall gameplay of BOOM, with decision making being a key concern.

We are trying to get everyone on the same page and some decision making is not really good. That’s it…I think I could do better in laning. I think laning is fine but overall gameplay and the map movements are not that way.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>With the new roster that includes xNova, John \"<strong>Natsumi-</strong>\" Vargas, and Kenny \"<strong>Xepher</strong>\" Deo, BOOM is reversing its fortunes after being the best team in SEA last season. The team has fallen short against Talon Esports, Bleed Esports, Execration, and Geek Slate, putting it in a very dangerous position regarding Division 2 relegation.</p><p>Furthermore, xNova, who last played in SEA with WarriorsGaming.Unity in 2017 and has played for Chinese teams ever since, also talked about the challenge of returning to the region.</p><p><em>“Playing in SEA is kinda new to me. The last time I played it was so many years ago in Warriors Gaming and everyone is new to me so it’s a really good and new experience…The strategy and gameplay wise, for sure, there is difference and that is why we have been struggling this season. Because in China, we are basically all on the same page and we have the same ideas but for now, we are still working on it.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>With the pedigree that BOOM's players bring to the table, the team had one of the stronger lineups on paper during the shuffle season, but the first few series have shown that there is still a lot to be done. The revised format of the DPC 2023 has resulted in a much shorter time gap between series, which appears to be working against BOOM. </p><p>With only two series remaining, the team will be eager to win and maintain its position in Division I, after which it can devote some time to establish synergy and return better in the next season.</p><p>BOOM will play Team SMG on 23rd Jan 2023 as part of its next series of the season.  </p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#E7362B;border-left:10px solid #E7362B\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/fnatic-edges-closer-to-relegation-following-5th-consecutive-loss-in-sea-dpc\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fnatic Edges Closer to Relegation Following 5th Consecutive Loss in SEA DPC</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\">",

According to Alpha Clasher, Yash Raj was inundated with messages from other esports companies and tournament organizers. <em>\"I talked with Yash Raj and asked him why he left. As you guys know, Yash Raj was the esports manager of Hydra, so he was connected to all esports companies and tournament organizers. All these used to message him, for example, Secret is playing great, and we need an assaulter in the lineup. So, he was like, Should I focus on my work or respond to these messages? I am not able to focus on my life.’ Then again, he said that people used to message him to improve the lineup, pay attention to Hydra's lineup, and much more,\"</em> he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Alpha Clasher explained that Yash Raj wanted to focus on his work, but he couldn't due to the overwhelming number of messages he used to receive. And he ultimately decided to step away from the team.</p> <p>Yash Raj announced his departure from Hydra through an Instagram story that simply read, \"Left 🐉.\" Although the announcement implied that he had left Hydra, it was vague and did not provide context or explain why he had made the decision to do so. Alpha Clasher expressed his belief that the announcement should have been more detailed in order to avoid confusion and negative reactions from the community.</p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <p>Following this, Alpha Clasher explained that Yash Raj is not well-versed in social media. <em>\"He does not have much knowledge about social media. He is a pure corporate guy, he knows how to handle people, not social media. I hope you guys understand,\"</em> he said. He also suggested that if Yash Raj had consulted him before making the announcement, he would have been able to provide guidance on how to handle the situation in a more effective manner.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

Song of Nunu and Mageseeker are also a part of the same franchise but they tell stories for different regions.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Ruined King covered the Ruination storyline while Song of Nunu is supposed to cover Frejlordian lore. We also had a spinoff sidescroller game Hextech Mayhem that showed Ziggs and Heimerdinger but it was light on the lore front. Mageseeker on the other hand will show Sylas’ perspective of his fight for Demacia.&nbsp;</p><p>The game was leaked by the South Korean Games Rating Committee. We expect Mageseeker to follow the story of Sylas the Unshackled, a Demacian citizen who worked with the Mageseekers. But he was betrayed by the Mageseekers who imprisoned him. Eventually, he broke out of prison and now leads a band of allies who are willing to dethrone the Demacians and take control.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Demacia is also home to some of the most iconic champions like Lux and Garen. We do not know the premise of the Mageseeker story but we could either experience Sylas’ journey of growing up in a poor family and his eventual freedom&nbsp;after being imprisoned. Or we could see Sylas’ present campaign against Demacia with his troops.</p><p>Ruined King was an all-around solid RPG with an 89% positive rating on Steam. If Riot Forge maintains the same quality, Mageseeker could be yet another solid RPG from the studio. Song of Nunu which was announced before Mageseeker is likely to be the second game of the series after which Mageseeker will join as the third installment in the “League of Legends story” lineup.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#7EC623;border-left:10px solid #7EC623\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/is-riot-games-developing-a-new-game-mode-for-league-of-legends\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Is Riot Games Developing a New Game Mode for League of Legends?</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

During his five year tenure with NAVI, from 2010 to 2015, XBOCT became well-known as a legendary carry player and became a TI (The International) champion in 2011.</p><p>In 2018, XBOCT returned to his former organization as a coach while also reuniting with former teammate Danil <strong>\"Dendi\"</strong> Ishutin. However, the team was unable to qualify for The International 2018 (TI8) following a disappointing run in the Open Qualifiers.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>XBOCT thinks that Lil’s arrival became the downfall of NAVI in 2018</h2><p>According to<ins><a href=\"https://www.cybersport.ru/tags/dota-2/xboct-o-navi-s-tekh-por-kak-prishel-lil-i-ushel-rodjer-vse-poshlo-po\"> cybersports.ru</a></ins>, XBOCT started off by saying that the team’s performance went downhill following the arrival of Ilya <strong>\"Lil\"</strong> Ilyuk and the departure of Vladimir<strong> \"RodjER\" </strong>Nikogosian with the former being well-known for his toxicity.</p><p><em>“Ever since Lil came and RodjER left, everything went to s***. There was no saving the team at that point anymore. [Question: What's so bad about Lil?] The reasons behind it are so long, I could write a thesis about Lil alone. It's the basics of relationships. I mean, he played on a lot of teams. He wasn't the only problem, but he added even more to the [bad] situation as it was.”</em></p><p>He then went on to talk about the 2018 NAVI roster in general, saying that he tried his best to coach the roster while also trying to bond with them but it was to no avail.</p><p><em>“That's what I say, as if they are all freaks, and I'm good. No, in fact I also tried to help for a while, tried to do a lot of things, played with them all the time, watched replays, hung out with the players everywhere, took them out together.

In the beginning, I directly tried and constantly talked to each of them, with all of them together. I really tried to solve problems, but not everyone gave me feedback.

He also praised their opponents for the valuable experience. He talked about the team’s undefeated streak but he noted that it would be useless to have the streak in the first place if the team did not learn anything.</p><p><em>“On one hand, I'm surprised that the match against Darkside was hard. On the other hand, we expected this from them - it's Dota, a random game. Any moment in a game can get tough. It's even good that we're playing games like that now, rather than at the Majors or the International, where we would not be ready to play games like this series. So I'm happy, in principle. It would have been worse if we had gone through undefeated against all the teams [with a score of] 2-0 without any issues in the DPC - it would basically be useless for us. And now we had a great series against Darkside. I think there will be more games like that, so the main thing is to play every moment until the end and learn something from the games that we have played. ”</em></p><p>He also admitted that the team dropped an easy win against Darkside in Game One of the best of three, saying that the team let its guard down as the game progressed.</p><p><em>“The first map was easy enough, and at a certain point we even started to fan ourselves with item builds, looking for kills on the map instead of buying Scythe of Vyse for lockdown and killing Roshan. We would have ended the game after the second Roshan. But that's where the throwing started... Like I said, Dota 2 is such a game - that's why everyone likes it, even me. At any moment the game can completely flip and full randomness can happen. That's why it's very difficult to play the game super well all the time - it requires maximum concentration and a plan for the game that you have to do every minute.

        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Tour 1 of the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC) 2023 has not been great for some of the top teams that have changed rosters recently, and Team Secret in Western Europe (WEU) may be at the top of this list at the moment. With placement at the bottom of the points table, Clement \"<strong>Puppey</strong>\" Ivanov's team is at risk of relegation to Division II after having lost all four series played so far. Secret suffered its most recent loss against Entity. Even though it recorded its first game win of the tournament in this series, over the course of the best of three series, Secret was thoroughly outplayed, with few moments of pushback.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Team Secret vs Entity: Match recap and highlights</h2><p><strong>Recap</strong></p><p>In game 1, Entity dominated Secret on all fronts. Entity had a considerably speedier draft, and the team took full advantage of it by playing aggressively and were constantly on Secret's tail. Secret's slower draft left it unable to handle the enemy movements, with BOOM, in particular, having a difficult time throughout the game. Secret lost the game with minimal resistance, with only nine kills after 36 minutes compared to Entity's 40.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>In game 2, Secret went for Zayac's iconic Techies, and he made the most of it. The laning stage was even, but Secret's heroes started finding crucial kickoffs at regular intervals after it. Secret won a vital teamfight near the Roshan pit in the middle of the game when Entity overextended, giving Secret the upper hand. From there, the squad played methodically to secure its first game win of the tournament in 41 minutes.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Game 3 was nearly identical to the first, with Entity outperforming Secret in the laning stage. While BOOM played well in the midlane, Secret's heroes struggled to choose the appropriate battles in the other two lanes. This gave all cores on Entity the space they needed, and because the game's pace was slow at first, Stormstormer led the networth chart by a wide margin thanks to his farming abilities and Hand of Midas. With enough starting items acquired, Entity ramped up the aggression, resulting in Secret losing bodies one by one. Secret lost the game in 31 minutes after having only five kills against Entity's 30.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p><strong>Highlights</strong></p><p>Here are some highlights of the series.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Secret's recent slow start to the current season has been an unprecedented turnaround from where it stood a few months ago when it competed in The International 11 (TI11)'s grand final. THhe only change was Michał \"<strong>Nisha</strong>\" Jankowski being replaced by Miroslav \"<strong>BOOM</strong>\" Bian, but its impact on the team’s performance is evidently too significant. </p><p>Secret will play Tundra Esports, Nigma Galaxy, and Into The Breach (ITB) for the remaining series, but the series against Nigma and ITB will be crucial for the team to avoid relegation. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#E7362B;border-left:10px solid #E7362B\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/saksa-explains-tundras-recent-decline-in-form\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Saksa Explains Tundra’s Recent Decline in Form</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\">",

In this tournament, he is playing as an in-game leader (IGL) for the Team XSpark, who were one of the 16 directly invited teams in the Challenger Stage.</p><p>In a recent livestream, Hector revealed that TeamXSpark’s performance in the Challenger Stage was mediocre, and in order to perform well in the New State Mobile Open India, they needed to play properly. He stated that there are only ten days left for the main event and he plans to achieve a top 3 rank in the tournament. <em>“We need to perform well in the New State Mobile Open India. We qualified (for the next stage), but our rank was low. If we are investing so much time in the game, then we should play properly. I told my team that there are only ten days left for the New State Mobile Open India. If we play the game properly for these ten days, we might make it to the top 3. We might make it,” </em>he said.</p><p>He went on to explain that BGMI teams have an upper hand in the tournament over New State Mobile teams due to their exposure to BGMI LAN events.<em> \"New State Mobile teams are good, no doubt, but they do not have the experience that BGMI teams carry. So it is easy for us to handle LAN, the LAN pressure and all because of the LAN experience. So it will be easy for us,”</em> he said.</p><p>In a recent meeting with the team leader Scout, Hector and the rest of the TeamXSpark players discussed their performance in the tournament. Scout expressed that the players had played the qualifiers and other stages unseriously. He asked the players to focus on New State Mobile and aim to achieve a top 3 rank in the tournament.</p><p>Hector agreed with Scout and decided to focus completely on New State Mobile, as dividing his attention between the game and his BGMI streams would have a bad impact on the team as he is the IGL. He plans to grind and practice all day to improve his map knowledge, gun power and everything else, so as to improve the team's chances of success in the tournament.</p></div></div><div class=\"blockquote-section-mobileesports\"><div class=\"blockquote-img\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"22\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 22\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M9.65647 0.183639C3.78353 -0.855234 0 2.57305 0 8.96213V22H9.65647V11.0399H4.51765C4.23529 7.1441 4.68706 3.71582 9.09176 3.97553L9.65647 0.183639ZM24 0.183639C18.1271 -0.855234 14.3435 2.57305 14.3435 8.96213V22H24V11.0399H18.8612C18.5788 7.1441 19.0306 3.71582 23.4353 3.97553L24 0.183639Z\" fill=\"#108dd7\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-blockquote\"><div><div><blockquote>I agreed with him to grind all day and practice all day.

While Saksa acknowledged that the team has been struggling as of late in terms of performance, he stated that the team had multiple reasons behind its recent struggles.</p><p><em>“I'm not sure. There's probably a lot of reasons why we're playing like shit right now. I think we got together too early in the bootcamp and we don't have the right motivation. I guess those issues are getting in our way. I don't know, there seems to be a lot of reasons and it's really hard to pick one. One thing is superimposed on top of the other. What can I say, we just played like shit at the moment.”</em></p><p>However, despite the team’s recent struggles Saksa also noted the team will not give up during a series should a player within the team finds a way to achieve a comeback.</p><p>“Usually, if one of us sees a way to make a comeback, we act on that plan. But if there are no ideas, we usually give up. We had this option in the first game [against ITB] - the odds were minimal and the win was already effectively in our opponent's hands, but we decided to try regardless of the outcome if one of us saw a small chance of making a comeback. “</p><p>The North Macedonian player ended the interview by talking about the new DPC format. While he noted that the new format is a bit better than the previous season, he also noted that the format from the previous season allowed the team to prepare better.</p><p><em>“The current format is not good for us in the short term because we are used to a six-week tour&nbsp; where there is a lot of time to prepare for the next match. But overall, the new format is good. Six weeks is a very long time in my opinion. So the current system is not bad, we just need to adapt to it. I personally think the three weeks could be shortened even more, but even now it's fine. We are going in the right direction.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Despite the team’s recent decline in form, Tundra Esports are currently on top of the WEU standings alongside Team Liquid.

While fans think that the Indonesian squad’s star jungler Kairi \"<strong>Kairi</strong>\" Rayosdelsol was the only one doing the heavy lifting during the tournament, Hoon thinks that was not the case.

For months players have been complaining about going up against “sweaty” three-stacks when they are just trying to have fun even in casual game modes. Technical Director Samy Duc revealed how Apex Legends’ matchmaking works and how the existing system is being fully scrapped in favor of a new one.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>How Apex Legends’ matchmaking currently works</h2><p>Respawn revealed that the original matchmaking system designed for Apex legends uses progression, skill rating and matching as the three parameters to find players.&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>Progression </strong>system ties into rewards that incentivize playing certain game modes or using certain weapons/legends. Players play certain legends based on quests and it also affects their playstyle. Ranked play also requires players to secure high placement which can affect a player’s playstyle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Skill Rating</strong> is a numerical representation of a player’s skill. This number is intentionally hidden from players to avoid exploitation. Finally, the <strong>Matching</strong> algorithm is responsible for determining who’s in your game. Using the skill rating, it will group players together to form a match. Squads and matches are formed based on player availability.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>How Apex Legends’ matchmaking will work moving forward&nbsp;</h2><p>Duc revealed, <em>“Moving forward, all matchmaking will use the same skill rating technology, but each mode will use different tuning values based on what works best for that mode. This will allow us to more rapidly improve Apex Legends’ matchmaking across the board.”&nbsp;</em></p><p>The new system is more granular, and has many more buckets. This allows Apex Legends’ matching algorithm to make better decisions when placing players into matches.</p><p>Some of the changes have already gone live in some regions and it will roll out to all servers shortly. Respawn hopes that the changes will make the game more enjoyable for casuals and newer players.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#7EC623;border-left:10px solid #7EC623\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/guide/how-to-create-and-play-private-matches-in-apex-legends\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">How to Create and Play Private Matches in Apex Legends</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

As a result of winning three series in a row, the team sits comfortably at the top of the table in a league flooded with top teams. Following Blacklist's recent victory over Talon Esports, position five player Nico \"<strong>eyyou</strong>\" Barcelon explained how the five players came together. The plans to build this roster had been in the works for months with Carlo \"<strong>Kuku</strong>\" Palad as they looked for all five players hailing from the Philippines in order for the communication to be more effective. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Blacklist International arose from the urge for an all-Filipino squad, says eyyou</h2><p>Captain eyyou arrived for the post-match winner's interview following Blacklist's 2-1 victory over Talon in a close series. All five players on the squad did not play together in the previous season but were together during different periods in the past. As such eyyou was asked how the players reconnected.</p><p>Aside from the desire for an all-Filipino roster, there were other reasons for the emergence of Blacklist, eyyou said.</p><p><em>“I guess every one of us wants to build a Filipino team because there’s no Filipino [team] in the recent TI and it’s comfortable for us to speak our native language. I guess that’s one of the main reasons and we know everyone and there’s no toxicity inside the team.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Also during the interview, eyyou was asked if he had considered continuing on with Polaris Esports, which last season also had an all-Filipino roster. </p><p>According to the player, after his team's loss in The International 11's (TI11) last chance qualifier in October, the players on Polaris went their separate ways. So after Kuku also got eliminated from the qualifier, the two decided to work together for the DPC 2023 season.  </p><p><em>“I am not sure. We didn’t talk about it that much. I guess after LCQ (last chance qualifier) we were trying to form a team already because me and Kuku didn’t qualify for the main TI right? We just played at LCQ and after that time, we were talking about forming a team.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Eyyou and Kuku had previously played for TNC in 2019 and 2016. Their performance at TI6 is particularly notable since they defeated tournament favorites OG 2-0 and eliminated them from the contest. Kuku's Huskar gameplay in the second game has been lauded as a career high point.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>With help from some of the finest and most experienced players in the region, they will be seeking to have a good season and live up to the expectations of their star-studded status. On 20th Jan 2023, Blacklist will play its next series in the DPC 2023 against Execration, a team that has so far surprised many by winning three series in a row by 2-0 margins. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#E7362B;border-left:10px solid #E7362B\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/blacklist-international-continues-undefeated-streak-against-talon-esports-in-sea-dpc\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Blacklist International Continues Undefeated Streak Against Talon Esports In SEA DPC</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\">",

Like many other older generations of players, he revealed that Warcraft 3’s release during his youthful days along with the first iteration of Dota was a big factor towards his love for the game.</p><p><em>“At first I was very young, like 9 years old but Warcraft 3 was introduced at the time [along with DOTA] and the game was really popular during its generation. I saw my brother playing the game and I soon joined him in playing the game and it was fun. I don’t remember why, but the game was fun to play at the time.”</em></p><p>He then went on to talk about his competitive career. While he said that he struggled at first as he had a hard time convincing his parents that esports is a viable career path, he noted that he managed to convince them after joining his first professional esports organization with Fnatic in 2016.</p><p><em>“They were not supportive of me at first, they didn't understand esports at the time like with Asian families, they’re always hard on you. Like, they would want you to go to university, get good grades, graduate and then become an engineer or something but when I look back, that path is actually a lie. But when I got my first paycheck with Fnatic, they were convinced about my choice, like they’re simple parents. You get money, you get an okay life and they’re cool with it.”</em></p><p>He then ended the interview by talking about his future plans with Team SMG as he looks to guide the new roster into being a competitive team.</p><p><em>“Now things kind of changed though, for me. Things right now are like, I want to create something else. I want to create a team that is very amazing in Dota, like the best team in the game at the moment. I’m not playing for fun as much as I used to. I think being a professional player for a long time, at some point you will suffer and it all comes down to what you want to achieve. But what’s important for me now is like guiding other people to be the best version of themselves. That’s what I want to achieve with SMG for now.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Team SMG are currently fifth in the SEA DPC standings following its 2-1 victory over Fnatic, with many believing that the team might avoid relegation at the end of the first tour.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\">",

However, he also gave his thoughts on the region’s declining state during the current season as opposed to the previous one.</p><p><em>“Personally, I definitely think that NA is a lot worse than last year. I think there were 3 good teams for the majority of the year and I think nouns have also been very competitive. This year, TSM’s a question mark at the moment [due to roster changes] and we just completely lost Quincy Crew/Soniqs so that hurt the region a little bit. But nouns have been stepping up so maybe we still have 3 good teams in NA. But the rest of the teams are a question mark, since there are many foreign players that I have never seen before.”&nbsp;</em></p><p>Despite the declining quality of teams within the region, Cr1t- noted that his team have been managing to acquire good practices by playing against Western European &amp; South American teams.</p><p><em>“We’ve practiced a lot with the Western European teams as well as South American teams, so it’s not like we only played with NA teams but we also do not want to face any teams that we have not faced yet in the DPC.

In the recent episode of ASKTSM, AquaNox revealed the story behind this unique control setup while responding to a question. AquaNox explained that his past gaming experience led him to rely on his fingers and neglect his thumbs, resulting in slow thumb usage. As a result, he decided to use a three-finger control setup without using thumbs for BGMI, which has proven to be successful for him.

Responding to this question, AquaNox explained that he mostly played games on his PC and iPad, which led him to rely more on his fingers and made his thumb relatively slow.<em> “I didn’t use my thumb at all for whatever games I played. So I got used to using my fingers, and my thumb became very slow like it was weak. My thumb is still weak.

Following this, he stuck with the same control setup and got used to it.&nbsp;</p><p><br>However, adapting this unique control setup wasn’t exactly easy for Aquanox. <em>“The control setup was very difficult to use. At first, I wasn’t sure how to control it properly, and the phone was slipping very often. But slowly, with practice, I got used to this setup.

The kickoff event for 2023 will commence in February at Sao Paulo, Brazil. After the kickoff event, the regular season will commence in the Americas League, the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) league and Pacific League.&nbsp;</p><p>Each year, international leagues will expand by one team, until hitting a cap of 14 teams in 2027. Teams who win Challengers Ascension will earn a two-year promotion into their territory’s international league. Promoted teams will have the opportunity to prove themselves against the international league teams during the Valorant Champions Tour (VCT) season, receive similar league benefits, and have an equal chance to qualify for Masters and Champions.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>After two years, teams will return to their league to battle their way back through Challengers and Ascension tournaments. The qualification to the league has also been tweaked in the new format. Instead of the old Challengers format, we have a brand system. In 2023, Challengers will encompass more than 20 leagues around the world, ensuring every Valorant player from participating regions can make it to global events. Challenger Leagues will provide highly organized competitions that begin with open qualifiers and ladder the best teams into two splits of multi-week regular season play.</p><p>The goal of teams that are not part of franchised leagues is to make their way through Challengers events and qualify for international events. In addition to the international leagues and flagship LANs, Riot Games will also continue building the popular Game Changers circuit and partner with third-party tournament organizers for events across the globe in 2023.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#7EC623;border-left:10px solid #7EC623\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/orangutan-gaming-announces-addition-of-zini-and-capricious-to-female-valorant-team-sway-departs\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Orangutan Gaming Announces Addition of zini and capriciouS to Female Valorant Team, Sway Departs</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

In the past seasons of the MLBB Professional League (MPL) Philippines, specifically in Seasons 8 and 9, the squad had a rough start, which led to criticism and doubts about their abilities as a team. However, they were determined to improve and came back stronger in the next season, making a major comeback in Season 10, but ultimately losing against Blacklist International in the grand finals.</p><p>But ECHO did not let that defeat discourage them, they continued to train and work hard, and their efforts paid off when they were able to achieve sweet revenge against Blacklist International in the M4 World Championship. They dominated the series with a convincing 4-0 win, showing their improved skills and strategies as a team. ECHO was able to push Blacklist International to the brink, banning most of its signature picks such as Estes, Diggie, and Gloo, preventing their key players, especially Jonmar \"<strong>OhMyV33NUS</strong>\" Villaluna from performing at their maximum potential. </p><p>This strategy proved to be a key factor in their win, and prevented Blacklist International from securing a second consecutive world series title.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-image\" style=\"position:relative\"><figure class=\"_4hRLP\" style=\"min-height:150px\"><img src=\"https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2023-01%2F0501ad86-6a24-40e2-af45-d50f8902818b%2FBenny_MVP.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;dpr=1.0&amp;format=webp&amp;w=768\" data-src=\"https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2023-01%2F0501ad86-6a24-40e2-af45-d50f8902818b%2FBenny_MVP.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;dpr=1.0\" sizes=\"( max-width: 500px ) 98vw, ( max-width: 768px ) 48vw, 23vw\" width=\"600\" height=\"318\" alt=\"Bennyqt is the Grand Finals MVP of M4 World Championship\" class=\"qt-image gm-loaded gm-observing gm-observing-cb\" loading=\"lazy\"><noscript><img src=\"https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2023-01%2F0501ad86-6a24-40e2-af45-d50f8902818b%2FBenny_MVP.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;dpr=1.0&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Bennyqt is the Grand Finals MVP of M4 World Championship\"/></noscript><div class=\"story-element-caption-attribution-wrapper\"><figcaption class=\"story-element-image-attribution\"><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4meI1rzssQI\">Mobile Legends</a></p></div></figcaption></div></figure></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>ECHO’s star Gold Laner Bennyqt was named the M4 World Championship Grand Finals MVP thanks to his explosive gameplay with marksman heroes.

After Riot Games failed to communicate the Ranked start dates and time, and pushed out a cinematic that was below League of Legends' usual standards, the community took it upon itself to express how important the game is to the players. The players came together to voice how disheartening and sad it is to see the “downfall” of League of Legends. This overwhelming outpour was acknowledged by Riot Games and it released a video statement talking about where it went wrong and some of the corrective actions it plans to undertake in 2023. Over the years, players have been vocal about wanting more game modes in the game and Riot is finally addressing this.&nbsp;</p><p>League of Legends‘ executive producer Jeremy “<strong>Brightmoon</strong>” Lee and head of League Studio Andrei “<strong>Meddler</strong>” van Roon issued an apology and addressed some of the pain points. One of the biggest talking points of this video was the confirmation of a new game mode. Therefore, players can expect to see a new game mode in League of Legends very soon.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>What is the new game mode?</h2><p>Some of the things that Riot Games has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1614028905475870720?s=20&amp;t=mDNw7_bTNJ5WCxMxRyggTw\">vowed</a> to do in the coming months and season are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>A 2024 Season Start, champion-led cinematic.</p></li><li><p>Improving events and new modes including one this summer.</p></li><li><p>Continued investment in League's tech.</p></li><li><p>Better communication (more regular, transparent, proactive, etc).</p></li></ul><p>Riot Meddler acknowledged that one of the biggest missing pieces of the puzzle was the disappearance of game modes. He noted that League of Legends used to have a dedicated game mode team and that the team was moved on to build Teamfight Tactics (TFT). The developers said Riot’s been gradually rebuilding the game modes team but stated that it was not a priority. Brightmoon said, “<em>The good news is that we have a [game] modes team who is staffed up and ready to execute. In fact, just this week, we played a prototype for a new game mode.</em>”</p><p>Explaining the game mode further, Meddler said, “<em>This is a mode that involves four teams of two players who get matched up against each other in a series of deathmatch-like rounds, buy items, and level-up and so on between rounds.</em>” He added that it is currently “<em>janky</em>” but stated that the prototype is very promising.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>If you are new to League of Legends and are unfamiliar with featured game modes, here's a list of game modes that Riot Games previously released to celebrate in-game events:</p><ul><li><p>Ascension</p></li><li><p>Black Market Brawlers</p></li><li><p>Dark Star: Singularity</p></li><li><p>Definitely Not Dominion</p></li><li><p>Doom Bots</p></li><li><p>Hexakill</p></li><li><p>Hunt of the Blood Moon</p></li><li><p>Invasion</p></li><li><p>Legend of the Poro King</p></li><li><p>Nemesis Draft</p></li><li><p>Nexus Blitz</p></li><li><p>Nexus Siege</p></li><li><p>Odyssey: Extraction</p></li><li><p>One for All</p></li><li><p>OVERCHARGE</p></li><li><p>Snowdown Showdown</p></li><li><p>Ultra Rapid Fire</p></li><li><p>Ultimate Spellbook</p></li></ul></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Notably, Riot Games hopes to get this new game mode out and running by Summer 2023 and has promised to keep the player base informed through blog posts, teasers and the like.

In response, MortaL argued that it would not be appropriate to use the term \"collab\" when referring to these high-profile artists, as it would be too costly for the organization. He explained that true collaboration involves mutually beneficial partnerships, and that it would not be possible for S8UL Esports to work with these artists without spending a significant amount of money.<br></p><p>MortaL explained,. <em>\"If we work with some Bollywood star, that Bollywood star won't get any benefit from us. If a Bollywood star wants to benefit from us, they will have to pay us. Or else if we want benefits, we will have to pay them. That's how it works,\" </em>he added. Following this, MortaL stated that Bollywood stars do<em> not collaborate often</em>.</p><p><br><em>&nbsp;</em>MortaL explained that when it comes to collaborating with foreign YouTubers, the number of subscribers each creator has is important. <em>”If I have 7 Million subscribers, then YouTubers with Million or 5 Million will collaborate with me because it is an equal benefit for both. If they are benefitting from my 7 Million subscribers, and I am benefitting from their 5 Million subscribers, then only we will collaborate.\"</em> MortaL said that collaboration works the same way for all other creators as well, but it is a different thing when you are friends with the other artist.</p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>MortaL has collaborated with numerous artists throughout his career.

At the same time, he noted that they were well prepared and confident before the match.</p><p><em>“There was no excitement, because we are doing well. We are pretty confident in ourselves.

I feel like there's progress [in terms of playstyle and learning experience]. At KB there were mistakes on the line and in the game, but now I've made conclusions in terms of the progress and feel better. With Ivan [Pure] as the carry of the team, we have a normal synergy during the game.”&nbsp;</em></p><p>TORONTOTOKYO then noted the chemistry within the team has been building well, before ending the interview by talking about his expectations about the current tour with his new team.</p><p><em>“Me, Save- and Nightfall probably talk the most during the game.

In terms of expectations, for me at the moment is to qualify for the upcoming Majors. All teams can, in my theory, play well. DPC with Eastern European teams is not really that interesting to be honest, just in terms of play style differences. In the majors, it would be interesting to play with the Chinese teams as well as the Western European teams.”</em></p><p><em>[Transcription via <ins><a href=\"https://dota2.net/news/80383-torontotokyo-na-pyaterke-kayf-igrat-progress-est\">Dota2.net</a></ins>, Translation via <ins><a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/translator?share=generic#ru/en/%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BD%D0%B5%20%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BB%D0%BE%2C%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%83%20%D1%87%D1%82%D0%BE%20%D1%83%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%20%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%B5%20%D1%85%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%BE.%20%D0%9C%D1%8B%20%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B8%20%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8B%20%D0%B2%20%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B1%D0%B5.%20%D0%9D%D0%B5%20%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%2C%20%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA%20VP%20%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%82%20%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%2C%20%D1%85%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%BE%20%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%20%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%BE%2C%20%D0%BD%D0%BE%20%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BB%D0%B8%20%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%20%D0%BA%20%D0%BB%D1%8E%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%83%20%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%83%2C%20%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B7%20%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%BB%D0%B8.%20%3C%E2%80%A6%3E%0A%0A%D0%9D%D0%B0%20%22%D0%BF%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%B5%22%20%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%84%20%5B%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%5D.%20%D0%A7%D1%83%D0%B2%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%8E%2C%20%D1%87%D1%82%D0%BE%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%81%20%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C.%20%D0%9D%D0%B0%20%D0%9A%D0%92%20%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BB%D0%B8%20%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BA%D0%B8%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B8%20%D0%B8%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%20%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B5%2C%20%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B9%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%81%20%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B5%20%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%8B%20%D1%81%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BB%20%D0%B8%20%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%87%D1%88%D0%B5%20%D1%87%D1%83%D0%B2%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%8E%20%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B1%D1%8F.%20\">DeepL</a></ins>]</em></p><p>BetBoom Team’s next match will be against HellRaisers on 14th January.

On 12th January, the Sentinels Twitter account posted a video clip featuring the Valorant team’s coach Don “<strong>SyykoNT</strong>” Muir, and star player Tyson “<strong>TenZ</strong>” Ngo. While the clip itself was funny, a comment from former Sentinels player and in-game leader (IGL) Shahzeb “<strong>ShahZaM</strong>” Khan stirred controversy, gaining the attention of the Valorant community, fans, pros, and organizations alike.</p><p>The video featuring SyykoNT and TenZ was captioned, “<em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sentinels/status/1613665497991761924\">might have to give it a spin this weekend</a></em>,” a reference to Sentinels’ strategy book, a running joke in the community.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>What did ShahZaM comment?</h2><p>The video showed SyykoNT stumbling upon Sentinels’ “stratbook” roulette wheel that had instances like “TenZ, go kill!” written on it. Commenting on this post, ShahZaM said, “<em>Oh yeah, one time I spun the wheel and it landed on ‘Please play with Shroud, we don’t care if you win, just make it hype. We’ll personally guarantee you a spot in franchising if you do’</em>”</p><p>This was a reference to Sentinels roping in FPS superstar and veteran player Michael “<strong>Shroud</strong>” Grzesiek for the VCT NA Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ) in August 2022. Back then, Shroud also confirmed that he was just filling in for the LCQ as the controller player.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <p>Replying to ShahZaM’s accusation, Sentinels wrote, “<em>There's no way that would fit on the wheel.</em>” However, Sentinels CEO Rob Moore was not appreciative of the exchange. He commented, “<em>@ShahZaMk It’s weird that since you left all you talk about is how you want to be with the organization, when for all of 2022 you behaved like you didn’t want to be here.

You can own up to it and do better. don't lie to your players. best of luck to you and your new team.</em>”</p><p>Replying to this, Moore simply wrote, “<em>I did not</em>”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Valorant community has been “<em>grabbing popcorns</em>” and enjoying the drama that unfolded over a harmless video clip.

The latest Modern Warfare 2 update on 11th January removed the Shipment 24x7 playlist and brought back Shoot House 24x7, causing the players to share their frustration online. The developers have been adding new maps and modes to the active playlist. Notably, the Shoothouse map was added in Season 1, and Shipment was added in Season 1 Reloaded.</p><p>Shipment is one of the most iconic maps in the Call of Duty franchise and it was reimagined for Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer. Shipment was originally released in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare in 2007.&nbsp; Although the map is small in size, it enables players to go on killing sprees in multiplayer modes, making players constantly run and shoot and engage in combat.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Players left disappointed after Shipment playlist gets scrapped in MW2</h2><p>The Shipment map received a new look in Modern Warfare 2 and the developers removed the ability to climb on the crates. A new playlist, called the Shipment 24/7 playlist, was added to the game to celebrate the return of the iconic map. Players really loved this addition and it was an instant hit. Additionally, the map also received a holiday makeover via Shipmas or the Holiday Shipment map.&nbsp;</p><p>On Reddit, one user named pubgisDEAD <ins><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareII/comments/109crwe/shipment_is_gone_this_is_how_they_listen_to_the/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=embed&amp;utm_content=body&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_name=ffef6f94ca994267bb8d7cbf34611448&amp;utm_source=embedly&amp;utm_term=109crwe\">wrote</a></ins>, “<em>Shipment is gone, this is how they listen to the community.</em>” The post, at the time of writing this article, has 4.7K upvotes and 1.5K comments, with most of the users reflecting the same sentiment about Shipment 24x7.</p><p>Shipment 24/7 was the main mode that players predominantly chose to grind camos in Modern Warfare 2.&nbsp; Another user <ins><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareII/comments/109crwe/comment/j3xg7re/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">commented</a></ins>, “<em>Man... Shipment 24/7 is where I spent my time after work when I didn't have any of my friends on for Warzone and didn't have a lot of time for DMZ antics. This is a bummer…</em>”</p><p>Notably, the developers stated that players could expect this map to be in featured playlists throughout the rest of Season 1 in Modern Warfare 2. “<em>Whether you are ready to grind out the rest of those Orion Camo challenges or just embrace chaos, prepare for Shipment’s arrival with the Season 01 Reloaded update,</em>” stated the patch update blog post on 9th December.</p><p>Now, players are demanding the return of 'Shoot the Ship', which allowed them to play Shoot House and Shipment on a loop back in Modern Warfare 2019.</p><p>However, it is not all bad news if you are a Shipment fan. Players should note that the Shipment map is very much still in Modern Warfare 2. It is available to players via Quick Play mode.

Nine responded by saying that both Aui_2000 and the rest of his teammates are crucial to his recent successes.</p><p><em>“Honestly, I think that the biggest impact is that I have a team that believes in my abilities while pushing me to be better instead of turning me down, which I think Aui_2000 has been a huge help. Because I think that was the biggest issue for me as a player, just struggling with confidence during high stakes matches on stage. But now I have a team that trusts and believes in me, despite me feeding that Game Two [against Nigma].

In the wake of OG’s victory over Team Secret in the second series of the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC) Western Europe (WEU) 2023 Tour 1: Division I, captain Mikhail \"<strong>Misha</strong>\" Agatov discussed the transition from ATF to DM.

They attack you, they go back, they force movements, and they split heroes on the map so well. On the replay, it just seems like Tundra can’t do anything, but in the game it can be even impossible to land the gank on them in 20 minutes. You try to smoke - nobody is there. I can’t hit a single spell, they are so careful and then they go on you. They are definitely the top team now.

However, the <ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/shopify-rebellion-acquires-ex-eg-roster-as-it-announces-its-entry-into-dota-2\">team was signed at the last minute by Canadian-based organization Shopify Rebellion.</a></ins></p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Fly stated there were no hard feelings in regards to EG’s departure from NA</h2><p>During the winner’s post match interview, Shopify Rebellion’s Fly started off by talking about the departure of his former organization, Evil Geniuses from the region. However, he also noted that there were no hard feelings and that he is excited to play against his former team should the opportunity arise.</p><p><br><em>“We’ve had a long history with EG, and it’s been different people taking over EG so we had different relationships [with management] and COVID affected us as well. Coming into Shopify, we have this sort of this new journey and there has been a lot of excitement in regards to the new team. I don’t think there’s any hard feelings, I respect the players on that team a lot. I think they’re amazing and their run at TI11 was insane so I would be excited to play against them.”</em></p><p>Fly then went to answer Clinton <strong>\"Fear\"</strong> Loomis’s question regarding the roster’s questionable offlaner choices as the roster is known for grabbing carry players to play in the offlane.</p><p><em>“That’s a great question because once it was pretty clear that Nightfall was going to play at BetBoom Team, I previously said [in my podcast] that I wanted a natural offlaner. It’s not because you can’t take a carry player and transition him into an offlaner, that’s not the case at all because we were successful in certain periods with these players.”</em></p><p>He also noted that the acquisition of former TSM offlaner Jonáš <strong>\"SabeRLight-\"</strong> Volek has helped the team a lot as a natural offlaner allows them to explore new strategies.</p><p><em>“But I think it’s easier for the whole team [to recruit a natural offlaner] so we don’t need to have that learning process for the new player who’s transitioning from carry to offlane. So by having SabeRLight- we suddenly have all of these doors opening for us, he’s able to play these weird offlane heroes, like Enigma and Dark Seer. So like whatever we want to draft for the offlane, he already knows how to play these heroes so it's amazing to have a natural offlaner in SabeRLight-.</em></p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>[Relevant section begins at 5:23:00]</p><p>Shopify Rebellion will face Wildcard Gaming as its next opponents in the NA DPC on 14th January.

The new update which added back the Control limited-time mode, skins, and a Collection event, also included a “nerf” to Horizon and players can’t figure out if the change is actually a nerf or just a bug. Horizon’s accuracy when using her tactical ability is worse than what it was previously which heavily affects her viability.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Gravity Lift “nerf” to Horizon in Apex Legends could just be a bug</h2><p>In the current version of the game, Horizon does not get the same level of accuracy on her Gravity Lift as she used to. In case you didn’t know, her tactical ability creates a temporary lift as the name suggests and sends you up into the air for a very short duration. The ability can be used to reach the high ground in various parts of the map.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Advanced use cases of Gravity Lift involved players shooting while going up on the gravity lift or healing. You could also strafe during the process to avoid incoming damage, which made it one of the strongest tacticals in the game.&nbsp;There was a reduction to accuracy when using the ability, it was not too bad and players with decent tracking skills would still be able to shoot their targets.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Horizon is one of the most popular characters in the game across all ranks and she was the most-used legend in the previous patch. Respawn is yet to confirm if the change is intentional or not. It is most likely a bug as the change was not included in the patch notes.</p><p>In case the change is intentional and Respawn forgot to share information about it, it nerfs Horizon significantly. Her tactical ability was one of the strongest parts of her kit and not being able to use it in combat as effectively can hurt her place in the meta. Despite the nerfs, her passive Spacewalk still outclasses almost every other legend and she might still see play in ranked and competitive modes.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#7EC623;border-left:10px solid #7EC623\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/mobileesports/news/mortal-advises-apex-legends-mobile-to-build-a-community\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MortaL Advises Apex Legends Mobile to Build a Community</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

MortaL, known for his expertise in gaming along with his large following on social media platforms, believes that building a strong community is essential for a game to succeed in India. He suggested that game developers and organizers should collaborate with gaming content creators to invest in fun activities and community events.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>MortaL’s advice on community building for games</strong></h2><p>In a recent livestream, MortaL revealed that he is fond of Apex Legends Mobile and called it a <em>“good game.” </em>MortaL feels that other organizers and game developers should invite content creators to do some events together; doing so will build a strong relationship between the game and the community.</p> <p>Krafton, publisher of PUBG Mobile and Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), collaborated with content creators numerous times throughout the year. It collaborated with content creators to create content for its YouTube channel and hosts show matches.<ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/harbors-launch-in-valorant-celebrated-indian-culture\"> Valorant recently hosted a launch party for its Indian agent Harbor</a></ins> and planned several digital activities for players to indulge in.

They have to do such things; it is very beneficial for their game and helps build an audience.” </em>He added, <em>“Do fun activities, shoot a lot of fun activities. Invest a lot of time and money. If they do such activities, then only the game will only grow more in India.” </em>He also stated that investing in fun activities and community events is important not only for games in India but in other countries as well.&nbsp;<br></p><p>MortaL asserted that doing such activities and events is especially important for games that are not as widely accepted and have a small community. It can help these games grow their audience and reach a larger audience. He suggested that these efforts may not be as necessary for games that are already widely accepted, like BGMI and Valorant, as these games already have a large and engaged audience. But for other games that are struggling to find their footing, community-building activities are important.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-mobileesports\">",

According to a statement on his livestream, Saumraj was offered the opportunity to move to another country and compete in international PUBG Mobile tournaments.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Saumraj decides to stay in India and compete in BGMI tournaments amid ban</strong></h2><p>In a statement on his livestream, Saumraj revealed that he was approached by an organization to move to another region and compete in international tournaments as the game is unavailable in the country. However, Saumraj disagreed. <em>“I was offered to move to another country, but I don’t want to move abroad,”</em> he said. <em>“Moving abroad and playing the game from over there won’t be the same.”</em><br></p><p>Saumraj’s decision to stay in India, wait for the game to return, and then compete in the tournament from his home country is patriotic. Many professional players choose to move to other regions to have more opportunities to compete at a high level. <em>“I want to make my country proud. If I move to another country, I will have to take their citizenship to play the tournaments,”</em> he stated.</p><p><br>Earlier, Saumraj expressed his belief that even if Indian teams had got the opportunity to participate in the recently concluded PUBG Mobile Global Championship 2022 (PMGC 2022), they would not have performed well. Saumraj attributed the potential poor performance of Indian teams to the current block on BGMI in India, which has resulted in a lack of practice and official tournaments for Indian players. <em>“Indian teams wouldn’t even have qualified for PMGC 2022. Not a single team.”</em> Justifying the reason behind his cryptic statement, Saumraj added,<em> “Due to the current suspension of the game, we are lagging one year behind other international teams. It would take us one year of practice to recover from it</em>.”</p> </div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Saumraj’s statement is a clear representation of his dedication to his roots and passion for representing his country. It showcases his loyalty towards his country and his passion for contributing to the growth of the Indian gaming scene. His decision also serves as an inspiration to other players.&nbsp;</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-mobileesports\">",

Blitz explained they communicated with a number of top-tier players, including Artour \"<strong>Arteezy</strong>\" Babaev, Quinn \"<strong>Quinn</strong>\" Callahan, Alexander \"<strong>TORONTOTOKYO</strong>\" Khertek, and others, but Nisha responded very quickly. The team did not hesitate to sign Nisha as its new midlaner since he was at the top of their list. In addition, Blitz mentioned that he had received responses from players in Southeast Asia (SEA). </p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Blitz mentions the players who were considered for Liquid apart from Nisha</h2><p>Watching Max <strong>\"qojqva\"</strong> Bröcker play a ranked game on his Twitch livestream, Blitz took over the headphones and answered viewers' questions about who they engaged with to find Lasse <strong>\"MATUMBAMAN\"</strong> Urpalainen's replacement.</p><p>Blitz mentioned sending a soft offer to Arteezy, but he knew he wouldn't join. While talking with him and his Evil Geniuses teammate Andreas \"<strong>Cr1t-</strong>\" Nielsen, Blitz learned that the two were committed to continue playing together despite their lackluster result at The International 11 (TI11). Due to the fact that Liquid only had space for one in the midlane, this option was dropped.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Daniel \"<strong>Stormstormer</strong>\" Schoetzau from Entity was also contacted by Liquid.

Blitz stated that they were actively considering his candidature, but they needed confirmation on Nisha's decision first. Because Quinn was also in negotiations with Gaimin Gladiators, the organization asked him to make a choice right away and not consider them as a backup plan. Quinn then joined Gladiators.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>TORONTOTOKYO was another prominent player who approached Blitz and the company about joining Liquid.

He explained that this decision is a strategic approach to ensure that he is mentally prepared for the competition after the game's return.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Neyoo wants to avoid overthinking lowering his morale before BGMI returns</strong></h2><p>On the final day of the PUBG Mobile Global Championship 2022 (PMGC 2022), Neyoo hosted a watch party on his YouTube channel. Notably, prior to the start of PMGC 2022, Neyoo was inactive on his YouTube channel and did not stream for a couple of weeks. As a result, one of his viewers asked him when he would start playing BGMI. In response, Neyoo explained that he would continue playing classic matches to stay warmed up and in touch with the game, but he won’t play competitive scrims right now.&nbsp;</p> <p>Neyoo stated that if he plays scrims and does not perform well, he will end up nitpicking mistakes in his gameplay and start overthinking his gameplay even before the game’s return. <em>“I want the game to come first, then I will play it directly with complete focus. I don’t want to be stressed before the game comes,”</em> he said. <em>“What am I achieving by playing now? Am I winning trophies? No.”</em>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>“I agree that we are getting good team practice. That’s a hundred percent sure, but my entire team is not playing the game,”</em> he added.</p><p><br>Neyoo further explains that when the game comes out, he will start to focus on the team play, but right now, he wants to avoid playing with the team as it would potentially lead to overthinking and a decrease in morale. <em>“I will play my own game. I will keep the personal grind, individual grind going,”</em> he added.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Overall, Neyoo's decision to focus on personal practice and avoid scrims until the game's release is a thoughtful approach to ensure that he is mentally prepared for the competition. This mindset is not only important for professional players but for anyone who wants to excel in competitive gaming.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-mobileesports\">",

With the competitive season officially started, many were looking forward to seeing the newly established rosters making their professional debut in each of the regional leagues.&nbsp;</p><p>The Eastern Europe region already began its second set of matches for Week 1 of the EEU DPC 2023: Winter Tour as Team Spirit faced off against NAVI to start off the day.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Team Spirit vs NAVI: Match recap and highlights</h2><h3><strong><ins>Recap</ins></strong><ins>&nbsp;</ins></h3><p>Both teams had undergone roster changes during the off-season. Team Spirit announced that Denis <strong>\"Larl\"</strong> Sigitov will be replacing decorated midlaner Alexander <strong>\"TORONTOTOKYO\"</strong> Khertek as the latter departed for BetBoom Team, Larl’s former team.</p><p>On the other hand, Natus Vincere (NAVI) replaced the duo of Alexey <strong>“Solo” </strong>Berezin and Volodymyr <strong>“No[o]ne”</strong> Minenko with a young Kazakhstani duo of Arman <strong>\"Malady\"</strong> Orazbayev and Nikita <strong>\"Nicky`Cool\"</strong> Ostakhov.</p><h3><strong><ins>Game One</ins></strong></h3><p>The early game was fairly in favor of Team Spirit, as the team’s early aggression on its core heroes allowed them to gain a sizable networth advantage in the first twenty minutes of the game despite constantly trading blows with NAVI.</p><p>However, NAVI’s cohesion and synergy allowed them to outplay Team Spirit as the rest of the team allowed the duo of Alik <strong>“V-Tune”</strong> Vorobey’s Wraith King and Nicky`Cool’s Primal Beast in the midlane to achieve their item timings in the mid-game phase.</p><p>While Team Spirit were able to mitigate the damage done to their base, a decisive teamfight near the Roshan pit saw NAVI take down all of Spirit’s core heroes with two of them having no buybacks. Game One ended after 38 minutes, with NAVI delivering the first blow towards Team Spirit.</p><h3><strong><ins>Game Two</ins></strong></h3><p>After being humiliated in Game One, Team Spirit decided to wreak havoc in Game Two by drafting the duo of Ursa and Leshrac for Illya <strong>\"Yatoro\" </strong>Mulyarchuk and Larl while NAVI went for a more all-rounded draft with Batrider, Troll Warlord and Broodmother as their core heroes.</p><p>Despite NAVI’s early game potential, Yatoro’s Ursa and the rest of Team Spirit’s heroes were able to get the jump on NAVI as they led in terms of both net worth and experience while also rendering V-Tune’s Troll Warlord useless throughout the match. The game ended after 32 minutes with Team Spirit evening out the scoreline, as Yatoro’s Ursa went on a killing spree with 8 kills and 5 assists to his name.</p><h3><strong><ins>Game Three</ins></strong></h3><p>With the scoreline now even, both teams are looking to get one over the other as they are looking to win their first match of the season.</p><p>The early game was fairly quiet as there was little to no action for the first 15 minutes. However, in the mid-game phase Team Spirit managed to hit their item timings allowing the team to aggressively force out team fights.</p><p>While NAVI were able to defend its base numerous times, its core heroes lacked the damage needed to take down Spirit’s heroes during teamfights. The game ended after 33 minutes with Team Spirit securing their first win of the DPC season.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Team Spirit were looking a bit shaky following the Game One loss. However, the performance of Yatoro during the team’s reverse sweep win against NAVI did not go unnoticed as many praised the carry, noting that he was in great form. Team Spirit’s next opponents will be One Move on 14th January.</p><p>As for NAVI, there are signs of improvement however the team needed more time to gel together if they wish to qualify for the Lima Major by the end of the first tour.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\">",

        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>League of Legends (LoL) players are bracing themselves to start their climb in the new season that kicks off on 11th January for most regions. In traditional fashion, Riot Games detailed its roadmap for the League of Legends 2023 season in its new <ins><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X67xunE30Es&amp;ab_channel=LeagueofLegends\">LoL Pls</a></ins> video. One of the many highlights of the new season is the introduction of new champions to the game. Last year, players were treated to five new additions to the ever-expanding champion roster in League of Legends. This time Riot Games has promised a mix of new champions, as well as glow-ups to older champions. Product Lead for Champions Lexi “<strong>Riot Lexical</strong>” Gao revealed that Milio and Naafiri will be the first two new champions entering the Summoner’s Rift in early 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>After these two champions, players will also get the chance to meet a “<em>hangry jungler</em>” and an “<em>artistic mid-laner.</em>”</p><p>Milio will be the first new champion of 2023, followed by Naafiri, disclosed Riot Games. Notably, players were initially hinted about these two champions in 2022’s August <ins><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bvpaEM3BOU&amp;ab_channel=LeagueofLegends\">LoL Pls</a></ins> video. Lead champion producer Ryan “<strong>Reav3</strong>” Mireles talked about the new champions and gave some hints and clues about their origin. Milio is the Ixtali enchanter support and Naafiri is the Darkin mid-lane assassin who was teased last year.</p><p>Here’s everything we know about Milio and Naafiri so far.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Milio, the Ixtali enchanter support</h2><p>In 2022, Reav3 revealed Riot Games’ plan to release a male enchanter support from the region of Ixtal. However, Milio was in very early development back then. Reav3 added that Milio will show a very different side to Ixtal, far from the lavish palaces Qiyana grew up in. The 2022 teaser video showed an art teaser that showcased three cute and tiny orange creatures that could possibly be a part of the champion’s kit.</p><p>From the description that Lexical gave about Milio in the latest video, it is evident that he will use the fire axiom and that he’s very young. “<em>Milio uses fire not to raze cities, but to soothe wounds,</em>” Lexical stated, detailing that he also carries a backpack. His biggest challenge seems to be “<em>the Vidalion</em>” but Riot Games has not made it clear what or who exactly the Vidalion is.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-image\" style=\"position:relative\"><figure class=\"_4hRLP\" style=\"min-height:150px\"><img src=\"https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2022-08%2F66f5a5eb-9024-437e-a406-e2b2b4ac6863%2FFZ_X4ElXwAInzyC.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;dpr=1.0&amp;format=webp&amp;w=768\" data-src=\"https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2022-08%2F66f5a5eb-9024-437e-a406-e2b2b4ac6863%2FFZ_X4ElXwAInzyC.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;dpr=1.0\" sizes=\"( max-width: 500px ) 98vw, ( max-width: 768px ) 48vw, 23vw\" width=\"600\" height=\"318\" alt=\"Ixtali male enchanter support Milio\" class=\"qt-image gm-loaded gm-observing gm-observing-cb\" loading=\"lazy\"><noscript><img src=\"https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2022-08%2F66f5a5eb-9024-437e-a406-e2b2b4ac6863%2FFZ_X4ElXwAInzyC.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;dpr=1.0&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Ixtali male enchanter support Milio\"/></noscript><div class=\"story-element-caption-attribution-wrapper\"><figcaption class=\"story-element-image-attribution\"><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p><a href=\"https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/\">Riot Games</a></p></div></figcaption></div></figure></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Additionally, the LoL Pls video stated that Milio is journeying to Ixaocan, the capital city of Ixtal and that he will uncover the darkest secrets of Yun Tal, the working class of Ixaocan.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Naafiri is the Darkin Assassin</h2><p>While Milio will be extremely adorable, Riot revealed that Naafiri will be edgier. The Darkin Naafiri, after awakening from her slumber, is all set to track down her Darkin brethren. Last year, while teasing Naafiri, Reav3 used a ton of phrases like “<em>barking for some Darkin</em>”, “<em>throw me a fricking bone here</em>”, “<em>hounding</em>”, and “<em>believe you me</em>” while talking about this new champion. Riot also confirmed that the weapon for this Darkin is a dagger but did not disclose “<em>who, or what</em>” would be wielding it. So players immediately imagined Naafiri, the mid-lane assassin, to be in the form of a wolf or a dog that uses the dagger that was revealed in 2022’s LoL Pls video.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-image\" style=\"position:relative\"><figure class=\"_4hRLP\" style=\"min-height:150px\"><img src=\"https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2022-08%2Fe8bb7868-c213-493f-9512-8e48efd97e0a%2FFZ_qrKQXEAAHytx.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;dpr=1.0&amp;format=webp&amp;w=768\" data-src=\"https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2022-08%2Fe8bb7868-c213-493f-9512-8e48efd97e0a%2FFZ_qrKQXEAAHytx.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;dpr=1.0\" sizes=\"( max-width: 500px ) 98vw, ( max-width: 768px ) 48vw, 23vw\" width=\"600\" height=\"318\" alt=\"Darkin Dagger&amp;nbsp;\" class=\"qt-image gm-loaded gm-observing gm-observing-cb\" loading=\"lazy\"><noscript><img src=\"https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2022-08%2Fe8bb7868-c213-493f-9512-8e48efd97e0a%2FFZ_qrKQXEAAHytx.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;dpr=1.0&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Darkin Dagger&amp;nbsp;\"/></noscript><div class=\"story-element-caption-attribution-wrapper\"><figcaption class=\"story-element-image-attribution\"><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p><a href=\"https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/\">Riot Games</a></p></div></figcaption></div></figure></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>In the Season 2023 reveal, Lexical added more context to this.

Being the manager of India's one of most successful esports organizations, he highlighted the role of a manager and the importance of networking in the industry. He also noted that while the role of a manager can be very satisfying, it requires a significant grind before one can be considered for a position in larger organizations like Hydra or S8UL Esports.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Sid highlights the skills required to be a successful manager in the esports industry</strong></h2><p>Sid stated that the common misconception about esports is that the only role available is that of a pro player. He went on to say that there are at least fifty other roles in the industry, including manager, content creator, coach, graphics designer, and more. He specifically highlighted the role of a manager and urged others to consider it.<em> \"I would definitely suggest one to be a manager; it is a very satisfying journey,\"</em> he added. However, Sid quickly points out that one should not become a manager just because he is.&nbsp;</p><p>Sid stressed the importance of having a wide network and good people skills. <em>\"To be a manager, there are three to four qualities that, I think, are necessary, be it a manager for pro players or a manager of content creators. I think the biggest thing you need to know is that your network should be big. If you are trying to be a manager, then you need to know people; you need to network properly,\"</em> Sid said. He also mentioned the importance of having a strong presence on social media platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter.</p><p>Further elaborating his statements, Sid added, <em>\"Your (Dynamo's) manager knows everyone in the industry, and everyone in the industry knows your manager. Because to get to you, people need to contact your manager, and he has to know people in order to get more work and good work for you. That's how it works.\"</em> He added, <em>\"You have to network to get work, is what I always say.\"</em></p><p>Sid stated that in order to excel in a managerial role within the esports industry, individuals should focus on developing strong people skills and conversational skills. He emphasized that cultivating these qualities is essential for those who are looking to pursue a career in the field of esports.</p><p>Despite the perks of a managerial role, such as the satisfaction of working in the industry, Sid acknowledged that the grind could be a bit too much. <em>\"It will never happen that you are a fresher, and an organization like Hydra or S8UL Esports will hire you. You have to climb your way up from the bottom. You have to start from a small organization to gain experience and climb up by networking. Then finally, there will be a possibility that you end up in places like Hydra, S8UL Esports, GodLike Esports, or Orangutan Gaming,\"</em> he added. He emphasized that all managers in the industry have worked their way up and that it usually takes around two to three years of grind before one can say that they have made it in the field.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

Among these teams, Global Esports stood out as the only Indian/South Asian team to earn a slot on the list. To compete at the top level of the Valorant competition, Global Esports put together a seven-player roster, which included five international players and two of its former Indian players. The team also decided to keep their remaining three former players as additional members. Notably, HellrangeR was not on the seven-player roster and was an additional member of the team. The organization announced that <ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/global-esports-plans-to-keep-at-least-two-indian-players-on-its-valorant-roster\">all team members would travel to Global Esports’ South Korea bootcamp to train and prepare for the tournament together</a></ins>. However,<ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/hellranger-is-not-sure-if-he-will-play-in-the-vct-2023-kick-off-tournament\"> HellrangeR was uncertain about getting the opportunity to play in the VCT 2023 tournament</a></ins>.</p> <p>During a recent livestream, HellrangeR made an interesting revelation, stating that he had received offers from six different organizations, including Global Esports, to join their Valorant teams. However, he could not reveal any details about the offers or the organizations that made them. <em>“I received these offers without contacting any organization; I didn’t mention anywhere that I was looking for a team (LFT),”</em> he said. His viewers were curious to know which organizations had reached out to him, but he decided not to share any details.</p> <p>Following this, one of his viewers asked him if he had made a decision and chosen to join one of the organizations that had reached out to him. He replied that he had made a choice but did not reveal any further details about which organization he had chosen.</p><p><br>HellrangeR clarified that he neither contacted any organization nor was he not actively searching for a new team. <em>“I got calls from many organizations to build a VCT 2023 Ascension roster, assuming that I would be free because I was not announced in the seven, which is a fair assumption to make on their part. I never officially said anything, nor I’m saying anything now,”</em> he added.</p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>HellrangeR has established himself one of the most experienced and finest Valorant players in India.

From being stream-sniped during events to facing cheaters, there are plenty of reasons for him to quit Warzone, and many of those issues have been addressed by the developers.

He added, <em>“The game itself, the movement, the gun fights, everything feels pretty decent. It’s actually a lot better than I thought it was.”&nbsp;</em></p><p>However, not everything is sunshine and roses as he does not like the addition of bots to the game which seems to be his most significant issue.

He is currently competing with his own team “Tripods” and will be attempting to make it to the Apex Legends Global Series LAN events this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Apex Legends on the other hand is seeing some of its biggest creators leave the game as the game has remained largely the same since its release. Matchmaking is also a major point of concern and players want changes to be made to the ranked system and the skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) as well. If NICKMERCS does return to the Call of Duty franchise it is unlikely to happen before his competitive stint in Apex Legends ends.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#7EC623;border-left:10px solid #7EC623\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/warzone-2-system-shadowbans-players-when-they-get-over-10-kills\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Warzone 2 System Shadowbans Players When They Get Over 10 Kills</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

During this session, one of his viewers curiously asked him how Indian teams would have performed in PMGC 2022 if they had the opportunity to play in the championship. Responding to this question, Saumraj laughed and said, <em>“Indian teams wouldn’t even have qualified for PMGC 2022. Not a single team.”</em> Justifying the reason behind his cryptic statement, Saumraj added, <em>“Due to the current ban on the game, we are lagging one year behind other international teams. It would take us one year of practice to recover from it.”</em></p> <p>Another viewer sarcastically said the game would be banned again after practicing for one year.

Sneaky has been grinding Dota 2 ranked slowly and was tasked with unfortunate moments in his matches along the way. However, after playing ranked for a considerable amount of time, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1049gdn/sneakylol_reached_ancient_1_rank_in_under_300/\">Sneaky has finally reached Ancient 1</a> rank in Dota 2, around 3,800 to 4,000 MMR, in under 300 games. It is always exciting to see League of Legends players, pro or otherwise, trying their hand at Dota 2 and vice versa since most players try and stick to only one of these multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Sneaky’s Dota 2 ranked journey</h2><p>Sneaky almost exclusively played carry heroes in his ranked games, making his climb very impressive since the carry role in Dota 2 commands years of experience. He started playing and streaming Dota 2 with his friends who were ranked Archon, ranging from 2,000 to 2900 MMR. Notably, before Sneaky moved to League of Legends esports, he used to play Dota 1 against bots while he was professionally competing in World of Warcraft.</p><p>At first, Sneaky calibrated at Archon Two. </p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>He played with his friends till Legend One, 3,000 MMR, and soon after this, he was reportedly placed in Valve’s smurf pool. Following this, Sneaky was placed in the Ancient tier in the game, which translates to low tiers of Diamond and high tiers of Platinum in League of Legends ranked queues.&nbsp;</p><p>One Redditor <ins><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1049gdn/comment/j33luop/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">wrote</a></ins>, “<em>His [Sneaky’s] first hundred hours or approx 120 games were unranked, I believe he calibrated Crusader 5, reached legend 1 with his duo and trio, played solo for a bit, got placed in smurf queue and reached Ancient 1 in 6-7 games. He might still be in smurf queue so might climb fast.</em>”</p><p>While Sneaky did not calibrate at Crusader Five as the original poster said, he is still in the smurf queue and gaining more points per win. </p><p>After the game that placed him in Ancient One, Sneaky noted that he got around 60 points and added that he was 3890 MMR, as he checked his stats. He said, “<em>So I got 60 points for that game which is 20 x 3 because you normally get 20 points for a party win.</em>” According to <ins><a href=\"https://www.esportstales.com/dota-2/seasonal-rank-distribution-and-mmr-medals\">Esports Tales</a></ins>, as of October 2022, 87.78 percentile of Dota 2 players are placed below the Ancient 1 rank and one can confidently state that Sneaky is well on his way to the top tiers in Dota 2.&nbsp;</p><p>Another Redditor <ins><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1049gdn/comment/j349qa1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">said</a></ins>, “<em>Sneaky stands out mainly because other LoL pros have gotten into Dota before and didn't even last 10 games. This dude gets to Ancient 1. Does that mean we're getting Crystal Maiden Sneaky?</em>” subtly joking about Sneaky’s cosplay career.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Sneaky is not the only League of Legends pro to move to Dota 2. Last year, veteran player Paul \"<strong>sOAZ</strong>\" Boyer, who has played in teams like Fnatic and Origen, spoke about how Dota 2 offered creative freedom when it came to playing style, making it more enjoyable. He also noted that he played a ton of Dota 2 before making the switch to League of Legends.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\">",

With more and more people warming up to the idea of esports as a career, the scope for competitive gaming is increasing by the day. Esports tournaments allow fans to understand the titles in-depth and also provide them with the ultimate LAN experience. After the COVID-19 pandemic, 2022 saw the resurgence of LANs across the globe which gave a much-needed boost to the esports scene. According to a recent report by <ins><a href=\"https://escharts.com/news/most-watched-esports-games-2022\">Esports Charts</a></ins>, Riot Games’ flagship multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) title, League of Legends, was the most-watched esports title of 2022. Additionally, Riot’s other title Valorant also made it to the top 5 most-watched esports titles in 2022.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Top 5 most-watched esports games of 2022&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><strong>5. Valorant&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Although Valorant is far behind its counterpart Counter Strike: Global Offensive [CS: GO], the gap between the two games is gradually closing. Riot Games’ tactical FPS game Valorant recorded an incredible growth in viewership in 2022. The game accumulated 283.47 Million watch hours in 2022, which is 32.9% more than in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>The main event of the Valorant 2022 esports season – Valorant Champions 2022 – was the most popular tournament amongst all. It had a peak viewership of 1.5 Million viewers. Compared to 2021, the peak viewership has recorded around 27% growth in 2022.</p><p><strong>4. Dota 2&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Valve’s popular MOBA title Dota 2 secured fourth place on the list. The game acquired over 313.61 Million watch hours throughout 2022, a 10% decline from 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>Dota 2’s main esports event The International 2022 was the most popular Dota 2 tournament last year and it recorded over 1.7 Million peak viewers. Although this figure seems high, it is significantly lower than the peak viewership of The International 2021, which recorded a peak viewership of 2.7 Million.</p><p><strong>3. Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (ML:BB)</strong></p><p>Moonton’s popular mobile MOBA title,<ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/mobileesports/news/mobile-legends-bang-bang-was-the-most-watched-mobile-esports-game-in-2022\"> MLBB, was the most-watched mobile esports game of 2022</a></ins>. The game’s watch time decreased by 14.4% when compared to 2021 but its airtime saw an increase of 7%. This decrease in watch time could likely be attributed to the M4 World Championship, the World Championship of the 2022 esports season, taking place in January 2023 instead of 2022.</p><p>To sum it up, MLBB had a total of 331.47 Million hours of watch time in 2022. Mobile Legends Professional League (MPL) ID Season 9 was the most popular tournament last year with its finals being watched by more than 2.84 Million peak viewers.</p><p><strong>2. Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)</strong></p><p>Valve's popular tactical first-person shooter (FPS), CS:GO, was the second most-watched esports game of 2022. It accumulated over 448.41 Million hours of watch time. Surprisingly, the watch time has grown 8.5% when compared to 2021, despite direct competition from Riot Games’ FPS title Valorant. It is important to note that CS:GO had the highest airtime – 14.4K hours – of all other titles.</p><p>Notably, among all CS: GO tournaments in 2022, PGL Major Antwerp 2022 was the most famous one. The grand finals of the Belgian Major, which saw Natus Vincere and FaZe Clan going head-to-head, attracted over 2.1 Million peak viewers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. League of Legends</strong></p><p>League of Legends became the most-watched esports game for the second year running. It accumulated over 617 Million hours of watch time in 2022, which is 7% lower than in 2021. The 2022 World Championship or Worlds 2022, the main event of the League of Legends esports season, was one of the most popular esports tournaments across the globe. Worlds 2022 Grand Finals, which was played between <ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/t1-league-of-legends-roster-is-the-most-popular-esports-team-in-2022\">T1 and DRX</a></ins>, recorded a peak viewership of 5.1 Million viewers, which is around 22% higher than the peak viewership of World Championship 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>A fourth seed team has never won Worlds so far but Korean team <ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/a-cinderella-story-drx-is-worlds-2022-champion\">DRX rewrote League of Legends Esports history</a></ins> by hoisting the Summoner's Cup in 2022, completing its underdog story.&nbsp;</p><p>2022 was also a massive success for the Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) Series. Notably, the grand finals of MSI 2022 attracted over 2.1 Million peak viewers, which is higher than Worlds 2017 and 2018 peak viewers.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>It is interesting to note that out of the top 5 most-watched esports games of 2022, three are MOBA titles, and the other two are tactical FPS. Furthermore, only one title in the top 5 is a mobile game, while the rest are PC titles. Even though mobile esports has seen massive growth over the last few years, the reason for more titles not making this list is likely be attributed to the ban of Free Fire and Battlegrounds Mobile India (the Indian variant of PUBG Mobile) in India.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#7EC623;border-left:10px solid #7EC623\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/guide/league-of-legends-season-13-season-start-date-split-details-changes\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">League of Legends Season 13: Season Start Date, Split Details, &amp; Changes</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

Sixteen of the best PUBG Mobile teams from across the world are competing against each other for the ultimate title and the lion’s share in the prize pool of $1.5 Million USD. Unfortunately, no Indian team could compete in the tournament due to the unavailability of the game in the country. Notably, Influence Chemin, one of the sixteen finalists, is bearing the Indian flag in this global championship. Indian fans took note of this gesture by the all-Brazilian roster and have been praising the team on social media, pouring in love and support for Influence Chemin.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-mobileesports\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Two Indian esports organizations compete at PMGC 2022</strong></h2><p>The government of India suspended the Indian variant of PUBG Mobile, Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), on 28th July 2022. Amid the unavailability of the game, no official tournaments are being hosted in the country. However, the criterion for the last slot in the PMGC 2022 was undefined for a long time. As a result, fans speculated that the slot would be allocated to an Indian team. Krafton did not explicitly mention anything, and an Indian team participating was mere speculation. In late November, Krafton revised the tournament format of PMGC 2022 and allocated the last remaining slot to one more qualifying team from the league stage. Following this, fans were disappointed to find out that <ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/mobileesports/news/indian-teams-will-not-compete-in-the-pmgc-2022-grand-finals\">no Indian teams would be able to participate in PMGC 2022</a></ins>.&nbsp;</p><p>Although no Indian teams could participate in PMGC 2022, two Indian esports organizations are a part of the championship – GodLike Stalwart and Influence Chemin. Stalwart GodLike is a collaboration between two Indian organizations, i.e., Stalwart Esports and GodLike Esports. It features a four-player Mongolian roster for PMGC 2022. On the other hand, Influence Chemin is a collaboration between the Brazilian organization Influence Rage and the Indian organization Chemin Esports. For PMGC 2022, Influence Chemin features a five-player Brazilian roster.</p><p>To show off its roots, Influence Chemin has featured the Indian flag on the right arm sleeve of its PMGC 2022 jersey and the Brazilian flag on the left arm sleeve. Meanwhile, Stalwart Esports only features the flag of Mongolia on its jersey’s right arm sleeve.&nbsp;</p><p>Professional Indian BGMI player and content creator Tanmay “<strong>Sc0utOP</strong>” Singh also reacted to Influence Chemin bearing India’s flag. “<em>That’s insane! I did not see it. Really? Influence Chemin’s jersey features India’s flag?!

Playing with the same teammates is always a big plus point as we are already familiar with each other’s gameplay and have great synergy, which will come in handy for upcoming tournaments.”</em></p> </div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Although Brawl Stars is not among the top games in India, it is slowly gaining popularity amongst the audience. Revenant Esports making a move in Brawl Stars might propel the game’s popularity even further.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-mobileesports\">",

While the results were beyond satisfactory, fans were still eagerly awaiting the iconic Chou specialist to step on to the world stage.</p><p>It was not until ECHO’s final match against RSG SG in the group stage that Yawi showed up as the team’s roamer. He even claimed the match MVP (Most Valuable Player) due to his overwhelming presence across the map and the team fights.</p><p>Through a post-match press conference, Yawi shared his thoughts on&nbsp; the team’s decision to have him skip two of the Group Stage matches in the M4 World Championship.</p><p><em>“I understand that, of course, I don’t want to force myself to play, especially if my teammates are not comfortable, so I waited for them to be ok,”</em> he said. <em>“I also trust Jaypee a lot because he is indeed strong.”</em></p><p>For Yawi, being able to compete in the world series event is one of his biggest achievements and he does not want to let anything ruin it for him and his team, not even his recent issue.</p><p><em>“A lot has happened to us, especially to me. But, I’m still focused on M4 [World Championship]. I’m not looking for the MVP [title], I just want to win,”</em> he said.</p><p><em>“Since the beginning, it has been my dream to step on the world stage. And now, I’m super focused. Of course, I have to think about my team because we need to be the champion,”</em> Yawi added.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-image\" style=\"position:relative\"><figure class=\"_4hRLP\" style=\"min-height:150px\"><img src=\"https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2023-01%2F6615e3ff-5e34-4c64-98eb-1b2f51405d47%2FECHO_win_RSG_SG.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;dpr=1.0&amp;format=webp&amp;w=768\" data-src=\"https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2023-01%2F6615e3ff-5e34-4c64-98eb-1b2f51405d47%2FECHO_win_RSG_SG.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;dpr=1.0\" sizes=\"( max-width: 500px ) 98vw, ( max-width: 768px ) 48vw, 23vw\" width=\"600\" height=\"318\" alt=\"ECHO dominates RSG SG in the M4 World Championship Group Stage\" class=\"qt-image gm-loaded gm-observing gm-observing-cb\" loading=\"lazy\"><noscript><img src=\"https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2023-01%2F6615e3ff-5e34-4c64-98eb-1b2f51405d47%2FECHO_win_RSG_SG.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;dpr=1.0&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"ECHO dominates RSG SG in the M4 World Championship Group Stage\"/></noscript><div class=\"story-element-caption-attribution-wrapper\"><figcaption class=\"story-element-image-attribution\"><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p>Moonton</p></div></figcaption></div></figure></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#108DD7;border-left:10px solid #108DD7\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/mobileesports/news/m4-world-championship-playoffs-bracket-schedule-and-results\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">M4 World Championship Playoffs: Schedule, Results, and Other Details</a></span></p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>ECHO shall face Team HAQ on the opening day of the M4 World Championship playoffs.

After watching Hasan \"<strong>HasanAbi</strong>\" Doğan Piker outline his goals for 2023 on stream, xQc also created a New Year's resolution list and shared some of the goals he wants to achieve both on-stream and off-stream in 2023.

He said, <em>“One…Beat Minecraft 20:38 speed run. That's one! Two... subathon before Q3. I think that's fair enough. Uhm... hold up! This is realistic. Be on time for stream 75% of the time.”</em></p><p>While xQc has been considering doing a subathon for many months now, the streamer has not gotten around to doing it yet. The concept of a subathon is simple: Every time a new viewer subscribes to the stream, time is added to the countdown clock which will notify how long they have to stream for. Subathon is a combination of the words ‘subscribers’ and ‘marathon.’ Subathon was introduced first in 2021, when streamer and content creator Ludwig Ahgren streamed for 31 days straight, including while he was sleeping.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>xQc’s off-stream goals</h2><p>The former Overwatch pro’s off-stream goals include:</p><ul><li><p>Getting a driver’s license</p></li><li><p>Hire a chef and eat better</p></li><li><p>Go on walks, and exercise sometimes since he wanted to set the bar low</p></li><li><p>Focus on the things that matter</p></li></ul><p>Notably, this is not the first time xQc has jotted down his New Year Resolutions on stream. Last year in 2022, some of his goals included scheduling his streams better, being nicer to people including his moronic chatters, and also paying his moderators what they deserve.&nbsp;</p><p>Though most of his goals are pretty achievable, only time will tell if we will actually witness an xQc subathon or listen to his podcast(s) in 2023.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#7EC623;border-left:10px solid #7EC623\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/xqcs-steam-replay-shows-he-played-82-new-games-in-2022\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">xQc’s Steam Replay Shows He Played 82 New Games in 2022</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

The pro player decided not to compete in the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC) 2023 as he wanted to take a break. A month after this decision was announced publicly, the player seems to be having a great time off, as he was recently observed cosplaying a character from the role-playing game Genshin Impact. Ame wore a costume along with a wig reminiscent of Tartaglia (also known as Childe) from Genshin Impact. The player appeared in a video with three girls who were also cosplaying as three different characters from Genshin Impact. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Ame spends his time off competitive Dota 2 by cosplaying</h2><p>The revelation that Ame will not compete in the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC) 2023 disappointed many fans worldwide, but the player has found ways to communicate with them through regular livestreaming and shenanigans like cosplaying.</p><p>Ame posted a roughly two-minute video on the video sharing site Bilibili in which he posed in various ways while dressed as Tartaglia, the character from Genshin. This player did an excellent job of presenting Tartaglia as he wore a fur coat, wig, and eye makeup. He encountered other people dressed as Genshin Impact characters cosplaying as the Raiden Shogun, Kamisato Ayaka, and Gan Yu in the second part of the video.

The team recently rebuilt after some of his teammates left as well. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Furthermore, since the player announced his decision to take time off during long-running rumors that he would be retiring after The International 11 (TI11), it remains to be seen if he will return to competitive play at all.

Thug participated in the PUBG Mobile Star Challenge - Asia Finals in Thailand in 2018. During the tournament, he had a&nbsp; short conversation with the CEO and Head of Localization of Krafton, the developers of PUBG Mobile. This conversation inspired Thug to start S8UL Esports.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Thug expressed that his goal is to expand the team internationally and establish a headquarters in London or Los Angeles.

In this tournament, PUBG Mobile officials were also present, including Krafton’s erstwhile CEO Brendan Greene and Head of Localization Jay Kim. Thug revealed that this tournament and his meeting with the officials at the venue played a crucial role in shaping his esports journey.&nbsp;</p><p>During the vlog, Snax asked Thug if he expected to reach such heights with S8UL Esports. In response, Thug revealed that he was one of the few people who got a chance to meet Brendan Greene and Jay Kim at the PUBG Mobile Star Challenge - Asia Finals. “<em>Kim knew that India was a new region. I was very surprised (by the tournament) and asked him multiple questions with excitement. He told me that it was nothing, and I can’t imagine how big the gaming and esports industry is and its potential. He told me that Krafton needed someone in India that is willing to take a chance and go big, and that hit me,” </em>Thug added. <em>“When I was returning to India, I decided on the flight itself. I even told my teammates that it would be my last tournament as a player,” </em>he said.<em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>By the end of 2018, PUBG Mobile started to gain much popularity. Popular YouTuber and co-owner of S8UL Esports Naman “<strong>MortaL</strong>” Mathur was one of the fastest-growing YouTubers then. PUBG Mobile streamers, like Rahul “<strong>Nova</strong>” Dhankhar, MortaL, and Tanmay “<strong>Sc0utOP</strong>” Singh, started to stream PUBG Mobile regularly on their YouTube channels. This drew a massive audience towards PUBG Mobile as well as mobile gaming content creation.</p> <p><em>“I have been following gaming since 2015; I followed Entity Gaming, Global Esports, and Signify. I always noticed that they were playing international tournaments but weren’t getting recognition in India,” </em>Thug said. He revealed that when he returned to India after the tournament, he saw a lot of players streaming and creating content around PUBG Mobile, and with it, he realized that mobile gaming would be a big thing in India. <em>“I knew that mobile gaming was blowing up, and I realized that no one would take a step because no one has the knowledge. As I was following gaming for the past three years, I used to play only mobile games, so I felt that I needed to keep my brain and intent – intent to make it big . So I thought if not me, then who?”</em></p><h2><strong>Thug shares his vision for S8UL Esports</strong></h2><p>Thug also revealed his vision for S8UL Esports by stating, <em>“I think it is a sort of dream come true – the dream is not yet achieved,”</em> said Thug. <em>“My dream won’t be fulfilled until we have an international lineup. My dream is to go global with maybe a London (England) or Los Angeles (the United States of America) headquarters from where we operate, at some point in my life,”</em> he added.</p> <p><em>Thug believes that his esports team, S8UL Esports, is the undisputed champion in India and that they achieved this status in 2022.</em></p> </div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>2022 was possibly the best year for S8UL Esports so far.

A former teammate of SumaiL, Max \"<strong>qojqva</strong>\" Bröcker, discussed his opinion of the player as he recalled his experiences with him. Qojqva perceived SumaiL's arrogance in a very similar light as the community’s, but he found that the time he spent with SumaiL to be quite pleasant in the short while they were squad mates. At the same time, qojqva mentioned that SumaiL was quite confident concerning his choice of heroes. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Qojqva shares that SumaiL is not as arrogant as his reputation suggests</h2><p>During a recent Twitch livestream, qojqva discussed how playing with SumaiL changed his perception of him. Despite qojqva believing SumaiL to be a player with an <em>\"entitled\"</em> mentality, he was able to have enjoyable interactions with him both within the game and outside as well. </p><p><em>“I have a good idea of how SumaiL is in a team. So, before SumaiL joined Liquid or before he stood in for us for a few months, I thought SumaiL was super entitled, very arrogant, and hard to talk to but when I played with him in Liquid, I thought he was very nice to talk to, good to hang out in real life as well, discuss ideas so I very much enjoyed my stays with SumaiL in and outside of the game.”</em></p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>For a little more than a month in 2021, SumaiL stood in for Samuel \"<strong>Boxi</strong>\" Svahn. After placing second in the regional league, the team failed to meet expectations at the WePlay AniMajor 2021, finishing 13th.</p><p>Qojqva also discussed Sumail's <em>\"ego\"</em> during the drafting stage, in addition to noting that his experience playing with Sumail only lasted for a brief period, so his views might not be completely representative of reality. </p><p><em>“He had an ego for sure because he would be like - just pick me any mid hero, the other guy is f**king awful anyway but it was not towards other people so it was fine. It wasn’t like - you guys are so bad and shit, no but I really liked playing with SumaiL. I think he was nice as a teammate. It wasn’t the whole picture obviously because he was a stand-in but from what I saw during the stand-in times, he was good.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>As qojqva pointed out, SumaiL's first aura of arrogance comes from when he lifted the Aegis of the Champions with Evil Geniuses at The International 5 (TI5).</p><p><em>“It’s definitely a reputation thing that people thought SumaiL is super cocky and arrogant. Because I mean probably that is what he was back in the day when he won TI, right? I can definitely see that.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>As of late, SumaiL has struggled to achieve the same level of success he achieved with Evil Geniuses. He has not risen to those heights during his time with OG, Team Secret, and Nigma Galaxy.

It was a successful November 2022, but the final month of the year did not fare so well in terms of numbers. December 2022 showcased that there were 55,000 fewer players. A drop of this sort was last seen 32 months ago. The last time the game lost more players was in April 2019, when it lost 66,286.9.

He further added that the offlane duo of Egor <strong>\"Nightfall\"</strong> Grigorenko and Vitalie<strong> \"Save-\"</strong> Melnic would be his second choice, as he thinks that duo will be harder to play against rather than Nightfall alone.</p><p><em>“[Question: Against which offlaners is it hard to stand on the lane?] Collapse, Nightfall with Save- - together, not separately.”</em></p><p>In addition to his answer, Watson also gave his reasoning on Collapse as his first choice of hardest offlaner to lane against. While he noted that Collapse’s play style as an offlaner has slightly mellowed out after winning The International 2021 (TI10) with Team Spirit, he also pointed out that it is still very hard to lane against the player itself.</p><p><em>“Collapse used to be much stronger. Now he’s still very strong, but my feeling was that when we [Hellraisers] played the first season of DPC right after Team Spirit won the International, Collapse’s aggressiveness as an offlaner was more painful. Either that or I was playing badly as a carry.``</em></p><p>[Transcriptions via <ins><a href=\"https://www.cybersport.ru/tags/dota-2/collapse-i-nightfall-s-save-watson-nazval-igrokov-protiv-kotorykh-emu-tiazhelee-vsego-stoiat-na-linii\">cybersport.ru</a></ins>, Translations via <ins><a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/translator?share=generic#ru/en/%D0%9A%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%80%D0%B8%20Entity%20%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B6%D0%B0%D0%BD%20Watson%20%D0%98%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BB%2C%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%20%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%85%20%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%20%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%83%20%D1%82%D1%8F%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B5%20%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE%20%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%8F%D1%82%D1%8C%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B8%20%D0%B2%20Dota%202.%20%D0%9C%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%BC%20%D0%BE%D0%BD%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%81%D1%8F%20%D0%B2%D0%BE%20%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%8F%20%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B0%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%20Twitch%2C%20%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%20%D1%81%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B9%20%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8%20%D0%98%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%20%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%20YouTube-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%20LEGENDWP.%0A%0A%0ACollapse%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%8C%D1%88%D0%B5%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%20%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B5%20%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%8F%D0%BB.%20\">DeepL</a></ins>]</p><p>Despite his decent debut outing with Entity at the BetBoom Xmas Show tournament, Watson will have a lot to prove in the upcoming season, as he will now be playing in the Western Europe (WEU) DPC league against the likes of TI11 Champions (The International 2022) Tundra Esports and Team Secret amongst other teams.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\">",

Gaimin Gladiators on the other hand, went for a more flexible draft in Faceless Void, Puck and Magnus. However, it would be Team Spirit who completely dominated the game as they ran down the Gladiators in terms of networth advantage. Despite the Gladiators’ attempt to defend its base, the team would eventually tapped out after 50 minutes, giving Team Spirit the first win.</p><p>In Game 2, Gaimin Gladiators wanted revenge. While Team Spirit went for Magomed <strong>\"Collapse\"</strong> Khalilov’s signature Magnus, the Gladiators managed to counter the pick by giving Sniper to Quinn in the midlane. While the early game was even between both teams, Quinn turned out to be the difference maker for his team as he gunned down all of Team Spirit’s heroes in multiple teamfights as the main damage dealer. Team Spirit ended up called ‘GG’ after 47 minutes.</p><p>In Game 3, Gaimin Gladiators was on the receiving end of the misery as Team Spirit played with an aggressive plan. Using the early stages to farm on their heroes like Ursa &amp; Leshrac, Team Spirit's players took advantage of their mid game timing to get the jump on the Gladiators. Understanding that they could no longer delay the inevitable, Gaimin Gladiators tapped out after the 41th minute mark.</p><p>Game 4 began with a reasonably competitive early phase, despite more heroes dying on Team Spirit’s side. However, with Gaimin Gladiators going for a more aggressive plan, things spiraled out of control for Team Spirit as they continued to feed one by one during the mid game phase. Team Spirit tried to fight until the end, but the damage was already done and the team was defeated in 46 minutes.</p><p>In game 5, Team Spirit went for comfort picks as it drafted Razor for Illya <strong>\"Yatoro\"</strong> Mulyarchuk, Tiny for Larl and Collapse’s signature Mars. Gaimin Gladiators on the other hand went all in on damage output as it chose Drow Ranger, Leshrac and Nature’s Prophet as the core trio.There was a lot less action in the first 10 minutes compared to the other games in the series as both teams traded kills while also farming for the late game phase. However, a single teamfight loss for Team Spirit around the 15th minute mark sent things spiraling out of control once again. While Team Spirit managed to hold for another 25 minutes, the team couldn't avert the inevitable as they tapped out after 40 minutes.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h3><strong><ins>Highlights</ins></strong></h3><p>Here are some of the highlights of the series.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Gaimin Gladiators will feel more satisfied than pleased as it manages to end the year on a high note. Despite the absence of its main carry, Gaimin Gladiators managed to acquire practice right before the start of the 2022/2023 Dota Pro Circuit (DPC) season while also proving that they will be looking to challenge for the top spot in Western Europe for the upcoming season.</p><p>While Team Spirit ended up achieving second place, the team had a strong showing at this event, dominating the group stages while also defeating the likes of Entity, Hellraisers and even Gaimin Gladiators right before the Grand Finals.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\">",

While he stated that the trial was unsuccessful at the time, he praised the player for being open-minded and cool during their time together.</p><p><em>“I played with him [DM]. Brought him in after we scouted him [from Hellraisers in late 2019] for a stint. I think the reason for the failure was mostly because our team was just terrible and didn’t have a lot of functionality at the time. We put him on the roster and it was hopeless for him.

He’s definitely more sacrificial than ATF was for sure. He has a larger utility of hero pool than ATF had, which I think was one of the main reasons for OG’s bad run at TI because I think that patch was weird and it majorly impacted ATF’s playstyle. So I think DM is a bit more flexible as an off-laner in terms of what OG wants in terms of strategies going forward, as he can play the required heroes needed as opposed to ATF.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>DM will make his debut with OG in the weeks to come in the first division of the Western Europe (WEU) DPC league.

Government bans led to Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) getting taken off the shelves but its tale may not have ended just yet. BGMI was easily the most popular game in Indian esports, but it&nbsp;has been out of commission for five months.&nbsp;However, recent developments at the Government of India may lead to good news for players.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Esports and Gaming Officially Recognized Under Indian Ministries</h2><p>The President of India Droupadi Murmu released a notification for the Cabinet Secretariat revealing that esports in India is now a part of “multi-sports events” under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. The Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming and Comics (AVGC) Promotion Task Force has also drafted a framework that could shape the future of esports in India as we know it.&nbsp;</p><p>The task force has outlined the importance of the online gaming sector which grew by 28% in 2021 and reached over USD $1.22 billion in valuation. BGMI was the number one mobile esports title that has contributed to the sector since its release and players are anxiously waiting for its return.</p><p>In 2022, the iQOO Battlegrounds Mobile India Series was the most viewed esports event in India with over 15 Million hours of watch time and over 460,000 peak concurrent viewers. BGMI also had the biggest prize pool for a single event in the Indian esports scene this year with the Battlegrounds Mobile India Pro Series Season 1 offering $260,577 in prize money. The second largest event was the BGMI Masters Series by NODWIN Gaming with over $190,923 up for grabs.</p><p>The reasons behind the ban on the game have been attributed to the <ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/mobileesports/guide/what-is-section-69a-under-which-bgmi-was-reportedly-banned\">sovereignty or integrity of India</a></ins>, the defense of India, and the security of the state under Section 69A of the Indian IT Act. The Government of India never clarified the reason behind the ban and we still do not know the reasons behind the ban officially.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Will BGMI Come Back?</h2><p>With esports being recognized as an important sector in India, it is possible that BGMI will come back owing to the massive impact it had in the country’s esports. Similar to the previous PUBG Mobile ban, it is possible that internal changes to BGMI to adhere to the country’s regulations could get the game reinstated on the mobile storefronts.&nbsp;</p><p>However, players need to note that if there are indeed serious security threats posed by the game, the Government will put the country’s best interests ahead of a single game, no matter how popular it is and what it means to a single industry. But fans shouldn’t be disheartened just yet. Krafton has been <ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/mobileesports/news/krafton-schedules-second-bgmi-server-maintenance-break-in-december\">scheduling maintenance breaks</a></ins> for a game that isn’t even live and many are speculating that the developers are working on bringing the game back as soon as possible.</p><p>Until we get official news from the horse’s mouth, it’s all speculation and we can only hope BGMI fans get their hands on the game again. The official recognition of esports and gaming marks a huge milestone and it could be the biggest moment in Indian esports till date. With or without BGMI, the future of Indian esports is looking bright.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#108DD7;border-left:10px solid #108DD7\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/mobileesports/originals/top-10-indian-bgmi-players-of-2022\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Top 10 Indian BGMI Players of 2022</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-mobileesports\">",

        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>The President of India Droupadi Murmu released a notification for the Cabinet Secretariat revealing that esports in India is now a part of “multi-sports events” under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (Yuvak Karyakram Aur Khel Mantralaya) under the subheading B. Department of Sports (Khel Vibhag). </p><p>Online gaming is also officially recognized and it falls under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. The Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming and Comics (AVGC) Promotion Task Force, which was established earlier this year after the Union Budget of 2022-23, has also submitted a report outlining the opportunities, challenges and recommended actions that the Government of India can take to promote and nurture the industry.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>What the Move Means for India</h2><p>AFK Gaming reached out to <strong>Abhishek Subbaiah, Managing Partner at Bridge Legal India</strong> and discussed the implications of the move. He stated that the development essentially indicates that the Central Government has recognized 'online gaming' and 'e-Sports' as businesses that should be handled at the Union level via the MEITY (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology) and Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports respectively. While there aren't any actual Legal effects yet, one can expect some nationwide regulations to be prescribed soon.&nbsp;</p><p>He said, <em>“The Devil will be in the details as always, however - what is 'online gaming', precisely? Will it include so-called 'real-money gambling'? Will it distinguish between games of skill and chance? How the Centre approaches this while keeping in mind the many State laws is something we will need to observe. All in all, still a positive first step to achieve some clarity since the Centre has recognised its responsibility (and more likely, the potential revenue to the Exchequer).”</em>&nbsp;</p><p><em>“I think the more fundamental difference that needs to be brought in, still, is that between gaming and gambling - gaming as we and the world know it today will always have ties with eSports, being the top-tier competitive level as with any other sport. What we can expect through regulation (hopefully) should be clarity on what the scope of 'online gaming' is exactly that the MEITY plans to regulate, as well as how it will coexist with State laws - it's entirely possible that this development could further complicate an already ambiguous Legal space.”</em> he added.</p><p>It is important to note that esports that fall under multi-sports events are recognized under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports but standalone events might not be included. It is currently unknown if esports tournaments hosted by independent tournament organizers will fall under the same regulation.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Esports Industry Reacts to Government of India Move</h2><p><strong>Mr. Anirudh Pandita, Founder, Loco</strong> stated, \"<em>We welcome the Government of India’s decision to recognise esports as a component of multi-sport events and bring online gaming under the remit of MeitY. With this legislation, the government has underlined the importance of building a vibrant gaming ecosystem and we believe that if the industry works in resonance with the government, then India will become a global gaming superpower soon. In the past two years, Loco has been the largest investor in India’s game streaming and esports ecosystem and in 2023, we look forward to continuing our investment in domestic gaming technology and content initiatives.”</em></p><p><strong>Lokesh Suji, Director, the Esports Federation of India and Vice President of the Asian Esports Federation</strong> stated, “<em>Great news for us to begin the New Year. We have been constantly working on establishing the difference between esports and iGaming, and finally, our efforts have been fulfilled. We welcome this announcement by our government under the leadership of Hon'ble PM Modi ji, which will open new avenues to pour in more investment opportunities in this booming industry. From now onwards, we will have to build the proper infrastructure, training facilities and coaching for our young esports athletes. Only a short time until we see Esports being placed in the same league as cricket, football, basketball, etc. and having similar fan power, scale and craze.”</em></p><p><strong>Rohit Jagasia, Founder and CEO, Revenant Esports </strong>stated<em>, “Today can be said to be the greatest day in Indian Esports history. The collective efforts of the entire gaming fraternity along with the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports have finally reaped its rewards. We can now proudly consider Esports a legitimate sport in India. This revolutionary decision will not only transform the country's gaming landscape in terms of improved infrastructure, funding, exposure and providing education about the sector but will also put India on the global Esports map as a force to be reckoned with.”&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>Mr Animesh Agarwal, Founder and CEO of 8bit Creatives and ex-esports athlete</strong><em> stated, “The entire Esports fraternity in India will be rejoicing with this welcome news which has certainly been a result of the gaming community's collective efforts spanning over the last few years. Esports has already been considered as a medal sport in the Olympics and Asian games and this news will further boost the sport in the country as it was long overdue. The industry inclusive of developers, players and creators as a whole is growing at a fast pace and to come full-circle this recognition will be very thriving for the industry.”</em></p><p><strong>Rohit Agarwal, Founder &amp; Director, Alpha Zegus,</strong> stated,<em> “One small step by the government, one giant leap for our industry. It's an absolute delight to see this news come in just when the new year is around the corner. Government recognizing esports as a multisport event will open a lot of doors for our space - whether it is more investors showing interest, bigger scale events, or even more support by family to take up esports as a career. We might also start seeing more international interest from both publishers and brands. This is the beginning of a new chapter for the industry.”</em></p><p><strong>Abhishek Aggarwal, Founder and CEO, Trinity Gaming, </strong>stated<strong>,</strong> <em>\"AVGC sectors are the front runner in the new age economy growth structure of the country and can generate a good number of job opportunities and scope for all associated stakeholders. India is expected to become one of the world’s leading markets in the gaming industry.\"</em></p><p><strong>Shiva Nandy, Founder and CEO, Skyesports, </strong>stated, <em>\"The inclusion of Esports under the Government of India (Allocation of Business Rules) is a big step to the widespread acceptance of the industry.  It is also a very positive sign towards the growth of Indian Esports and for a medal-winning approach. Furthermore, the GOI has displayed understanding about what Esports is by allocating it under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. I'm confident that in the coming years we will be able to create an ecosystem where we can train young talent for esports just like we do for other sports.\" </em></p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>AVGC Task Force Requests Framework to Regulate Online Skill Gaming</h2><p>The AVGC Promotion Task Force has recommended changes to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) and has requested a dedicated budget to promote the sector.&nbsp;</p><p>The government task force has recommended establishing incubators to accelerate the growth of startups in the AVGC industry and has asked the MIB to look into tax rebates, incentivizing foreign direct investments (FDI), and offering research and development opportunities to the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>The AVGC Task Force’s report revealed that the online gaming sector in India grew by 28% in 2021 and reached over USD $1.22 billion in valuation. It noted that the growth was fueled by the consumption habits of consumers and the rise of digital media. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the creation of the AVGC Promotion Task Force during the 2022-23 Union Budget and highlighted that India is among the top five markets in the world for mobile gaming.</p><p>The task force also outlined the importance of formal education for aspiring professionals in the AVGC sector. It noted that India is one of the youngest nations in the world with over 60% of the population in the working age group and about 46% of the population below 25 years of age. Formal education in the AVGC sector can help students join the industry and help grow it even further.</p><p>The Challenges of the AVGC Sector in India</p><p>While the government of India has shown interest in nurturing the AVGC industry, there are also some challenges that need to be tackled according to the AVGC task force.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>There is a lack of authentic data for the AVGC sector&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>A lack of dedicated vocational training for AVGC jobs</p></li><li><p>The quality of output and human resources of the AVGC industry needs to be improved through adequate training</p></li><li><p>A lack of research and development&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>A lack of regulatory frameworks&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>A lack of globally popular Indian IPs</p></li></ul><p>The AVGC Task Force reported that these challenges can be overcome through promotion of Indian content, gender equality,&nbsp; social inclusion, education, access to finance and technology, skilling and mentorship, and the creation of high-quality content.&nbsp;</p><p>Education and its standardization are essential according to the task force. It has recommended the introduction of new courses such as a Bachelors in Experimental Arts (Gaming), Game Art Design, Virtual Reality, and other important disciplines in the gaming, animation, and comic industry.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#7EC623;border-left:10px solid #7EC623\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/indian-government-does-not-plan-to-impose-a-time-limit-on-online-games\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Government Does Not Plan To Impose a Time Limit on Online Games</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

As of late, ten EEU players have been permanently banned by Valve due to account sharing and impersonating other teams during tournaments. Additionally, it was suspected that some of the players have been engaging in match-fixing or a 322 in&nbsp;Dota terms.</p><p>These actions undermine the competitive circuit's integrity and the audience’s experience, and are in violation of Valve's competitive regulations, which impose permanent bans on players that engage in such misconduct.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#E7362B;border-left:10px solid #E7362B\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/virtuspro-player-koma-among-ten-banned-for-account-sharing-and-impersonation-during-tournament-games\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Virtus.Pro Player Koma' Among Ten Banned for Account Sharing and Impersonation During Tournament Games</a></span></p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Players admitted that they had hired a programmer to deceive investigators &amp; tournament officials</h2><p><ins><a href=\"https://cyber.sports.ru/tribuna/blogs/wddshka/3104052.html\">In a conjoined statement for Cyber.Sports.ru,</a></ins> the recently banned Dota 2 players from Luna Gaming and S9 explained how they avoided punishment following an initial investigation by D2CL (Dota 2 Champions League) admins back in October 2022. They also shed some light on other details of the account sharing, which led to the permanent ban by Valve.</p><p>Viktor <strong>\"SuperNova\"</strong> Galichkin, one of the banned players did most of the explaining as he started off by saying that their manager and former S9 teammate, Lilskrip was the mastermind behind the situation as the players were playing in the D2CL Season 15 back in October 2022.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“At that point, Luna Gaming had decent results in various tournaments, including a few previous seasons of D2CL. Lilskrip, both manager at Luna and S9 player, convinced D2CL admins that Luna Gaming would start from the playoffs and S9 would take their place in the group. That's how S9 got to the tournament.”</em></p><p>However due to problems inside and outside of the game, both of the mentioned teams decided to swap rosters for their future matches during the tournament with the mutual agreement of splitting the prize money. Former Luna Gaming &amp; VP carry Kamil <strong>\"Koma`\"</strong> Biktimirov was initially against both teams’ decisions to swap rosters, however was persuaded otherwise.</p><p><em>\"And when some of the guys from \"S9\" and Luna Gaming agreed, the guys wrote me an offer to set it all up. And I ****ing just reacted negatively. But the guys said not to rush the decision, persuaded with arguments that we have nothing to play for and we needed more practice, that we are friends and we will have nothing for it\".</em></p><p>Once their opponents started to get tipped off that they were against other players from an anonymous source, Luna Gaming and S9 were suspected of unfair play in the match against NoSorry by D2CL staff officials.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“We logged into S9 accounts against NoSorry, won the first map, and during the draft of the second one, the opponents refused to play against us. That was because somebody DM'ed Y0nd [our opponent’s position 4] that we were using an observer [cheating method in which someone gets access to the observer feed, usually buys it]. Of course, there was no observer.”</em> said Koma` when talking about being found out by D2CL staff.</p><p>Following the situation, D2CL staff officials started their own investigation on both S9 and Luna Gaming. While they wanted to come clean at first, all of the players involved were worried about being banned permanently to the point where they faked evidence of their involvement by hiring a programmer. D2CL didn't find any wrongdoings and officially confirmed that Luna Gaming and S9 weren't cheating or sharing accounts at the time.</p><p><em>“D2CL admins started to message us to check our logs and look at who logged into the accounts. We didn't know what to do. We were ready to receive a ban, but then someone got the idea to hire a programmer to change the webpage code and make it look like it were our logs. We decided to use that opportunity instead.”</em> said Supernova.</p><p>However, two months later their past finally caught up with them as all ten players, that were previously from both Luna Gaming &amp; S9, were banned by Valve. While most of the players apologized for their mistakes, they also urged other professional players to not repeat their mistakes in the future before calling out tournament organizers to enhance their security protocols.</p><p><em>“We want to help close the breaches and vulnerabilities of high-level competition defenses. D2CL is a regular league with a $50,000 prize pool. Doesn't seem like an underground event in the LAN cafe for a case of beer, does it? But, as you see, the players did share the accounts and evaded the check-outs. We hope that Epic Esports Events and other TOs (Tournament Organizers) will use this case as an example. It would be way harder to do if these events had more strict voice-checks, web cameras, and similar measures.”</em></p><p>[transcriptions via <ins><a href=\"https://cyber.sports.ru/tribuna/blogs/wddshka/3104052.html\">Cyber.Sports.ru</a></ins>, translations via <ins><a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/translator?share=generic#ru/en/Koma%60%3A%20%C2%AB%D0%92%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%20%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B8%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BC%20%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%8E%D1%82%20%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8C%20%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%20%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%2C%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80%2C%20%C2%AB%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%20%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%20%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%8E%D1%82%D1%81%D1%8F%20%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%20%D1%83%20%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%80-1%2C%20%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%80-2%20%D0%B8%20%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%80-3%20%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%3F%C2%BB%20%D0%9D%D0%B5%20%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8E%2C%20%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA%20%D1%83%20%C2%AB%D0%A19%C2%BB%2C%20%D0%BD%D0%BE%20%D1%83%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%20%D0%B2%20Luna%20Gaming%20%D0%BD%D0%B5%20%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BB%D0%BE%20%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%20%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B5%C2%BB.%0A%0ASupernova%3A%20%C2%AB%D0%A3%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%20%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%20%D0%BD%D0%B5%20%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BB%D0%BE%2C%20%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B5%20%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%80%D1%8B%2C%20%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA%20D2CL%2C%20%E2%80%93%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%88%20%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9%20%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B4.%20%D0%A3%20%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8F%20%D1%81%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%82%20Illusion%E2%80%99%D0%B0...%20\">DeepL</a></ins>]</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Following the release of the statement, many believed that most of the bans were justified.

        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>In a recent livestream, popular Indian caster and content creator, Ocean Sharma, spoke about Valorant Mobile - Riot Games' upcoming mobile first-person shooter (FPS) title based on its popular PC game Valorant. Ocean revealed the tentative launch date of the game and claimed that it would be a big hit. Following this, he also expressed that he thinks that the game would be challenging for thumb players, and players might need to play with at least three-finger or four-finger layouts.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Ocean claims Valorant Mobile shall release by December 2023</strong></h2><p>Ocean was playing Tekken 7 in his recent livestream. During this session, one of his viewers asked him when Valorant Mobile would launch. Responding to this, Ocean said, <em>\"Valorant Mobile shall launch by the end of the next year. The beta version and everything might be released before that. However, the overall launch shall be completed by the end of the next year.\" </em>He added, <em>\"Valorant Mobile is gonna be a big hit.\"</em></p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Ocean states Valorant Mobile would be challenging for thumb players</strong></h2><p>In Valorant, players need to select an agent from the pool before the start of each game. Every agent has a different set of abilities; based on which agent you choose, you will be able to use four distinct abilities throughout that game. Along with gunplay, players need to utilize these abilities of agents to create a tactical advantage over the opponents and, ultimately, win the game.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Expressing his thoughts on the control setup of Valorant Mobile, Ocean said, <em>\"Valorant Mobile, I believe, would not be much compatible with thumb players. Because you will have to move, shoot, as well as use multiple abilities. At least you need to play it on a three-finger or a four-finger control setup if you want to enter the professional esports scene of Valorant Mobile.\"</em><br></p><p>In mobile games, control setup is mainly based on the usage of thumbs and fingers by the players. The default layout for most mobile games is the thumb layout, where players only use their thumbs to perform all the in-game activities. Notably, external devices, like Triggers and Controllers, are not allowed in competitive esports. Hence, with the surge in competition, players have adapted to three-finger and four-finger setups, where players use one or two fingers in addition to thumbs, respectively. These advanced setups allow players to perform multiple activities in the game simultaneously. This advanced setup is not limited to three-finger and four-finger; players can use as many fingers as they want to improve their control over the game.<br></p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <p>Valorant quickly attracted a massive player base right after its launch. With the development of its mobile version, Riot Games expects to translate this success to the mobile space. Although there are no official comments regarding Valorant Mobile's release, fans are hyped to play this new title on their mobile devices.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-mobileesports\">",

The release date was revealed on 22nd December. However, the release date was then updated to a later date as the previously announced date was incorrect. Dragapult in Pokemon UNITE is classified as a ranged attacker, adding to the pool of damage-type Pokemon in the roster. The playable Pokemon is also said to be very agile, as revealed in the Japanese teaser video. Dragapult starts off as its base form Dreepy and evolves to Drakloak, before evolving to its final form.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#108DD7;border-left:10px solid #108DD7\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/mobileesports/news/pokemon-unite-patch-1814-full-notes-and-updates\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pokemon UNITE Patch 1.8.1.4 Full Notes and Updates</a></span></p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>When will Dragapult be released in Pokemon UNITE</h2><p><strong>Dragapult is set to be released in Pokemon UNITE on 29th December</strong>, according to the official Twitter post.

The action can be repeated one more time while flying.</p><h3>Dragon Breath</h3><p>Breathes flames to damage enemies. The ground is then set on fire, slowing enemies and continuing to deal damage. During the Dragon Dance, the move may also be executed while flying, slowing enemies by scattering flames in their path.</p><h3>Phantom Force</h3><p>Becomes temporarily invisible and moves faster. The enhanced attack gauge gradually builds while invisible. Dragapult's attack speed briefly increases once the invisibility expires.</p><p>The cooldown of the move is shortened when an opponent is knocked unconscious, and Dragapult's attack power is permanently increased.</p><h3>Shadow Ball</h3><p>Fires a ball that marks targets up to four stacks. Attacking marked opponents increases the damage dealt and removes one mark. Dragapult's HP is restored and deals additional damage if all four marks disappear.</p><h3>UNITE Move: Dreep and Destroy</h3><p>Dragapult’s UNITE Move is yet to be revealed.

The duo mostly talked about Aui_2000’s journey throughout his professional career, playing with well-known names such as Jacky \"EternaLEnVy\" Mao and Syed \"SumaiL\" Hassan to name a few.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Thorin also asked Aui_2000 about the latter’s thoughts on Team Secret’s captain Clement <strong>\"Puppey\"</strong> Ivanov as a position five player as he had previously played with The International 2011 (TI1) winner in 2016 as Team Secret’s substitute player and coach. Furthermore, Thorin wanted Aui_2000 to explain Puppey’s impact as a hard support as the role tends to have the least resources available to them during a game.</p><p>Aui_2000 explained that Puppey’s timing with his spell-casting abilities is impeccable, as the latter never missed an opportunity to turn things around for his team. Additionally, he also pointed out that Puppey tends to have an impact with his playstyle as he can give back to the team if given enough resources.</p><p><em>“I feel like when I’m watching Puppey play, he will be very patient with his timing. People tend to miss opportunities within a game most of the time but not Puppey. There’s also this Team Secret playstyle, where Puppey would be given some resources to work with in the game and then provides a massive impact. Like, while Puppey is a natural five, he plays more like a position four support when he plays lane pushing heroes [such as Chen]. But obviously it’s still impressive to watch him after his long career, as he currently has so much success with his current team.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Despite having came second in the latest iteration of The International, Puppey remains as one of the most successful Dota 2 players in the scene, having won several Majors and TI1 while also remaining as the only player to have actively competed in every iteration of The International.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\">",

It has been Eastern Europe (EEU) that has been at the fore of this, with ten players permanently banned by Valve. Team Spirit's carry player Illya \"<strong>Yatoro</strong>\" Mulyarchuk shared his thoughts on the matter. He believes that all of them, except Kamil \"<strong>Koma`\"</strong> Biktimirov, deserved the repercussions. According to Yatoro, Koma` has been playing with him for the past three years and has put in so much effort that he would not engage in match fixing. A more lenient punishment might have been appropriate, according to him.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Yatoro says Koma should not have been permanently banned</h2><p>Yatoro was the latest in a series of personalities to express their thoughts on Valve's recent ban wave in a <a href=\"https://t.me/rainaddan/120\">Telegram post</a>. As Yatoro explained the bond he shares with Koma`, he stated that Koma wouldn't do anything like match fixing.</p><p><em>“I wanted to share my thoughts on 322 in which the banned players from the CIS, all of them 100% deserve it, except Kamil \"koma\". Kamil is a man who I can call a friend, we have been playing together at Dota for 3 years, constantly communicating about it, etc. Knowing his efforts and efforts to get on the team and become one of the best players in Dota, he would never do 322.”</em></p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>The ten players from EEU have been banned for sharing accounts and impersonating other teams during tournaments, but other players such as <a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/fishman-talks-about-valves-permanent-bans-says-there-may-be-more\">Dzmitry \"</a><strong><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/fishman-talks-about-valves-permanent-bans-says-there-may-be-more\">Fishman</a></strong><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/fishman-talks-about-valves-permanent-bans-says-there-may-be-more\">\" Palishchuk have also speculated that some of them may have engaged in 322</a> (a term used for intentionally throwing a game).</p><p>Yatoro admitted, however, that Koma` did play on two accounts. However, he considered a year's punishment adequate and a permanent ban unwarranted. </p><p><em>“Yes, he did play on two accts (accounts) because at the time he was playing for Luna Gaming (he did not know that they are 322 beasts) and at the same time he played bet guys, so sometimes he asked other players (which you all know) to play for him. Personally, in my opinion, a ban for a year would have been fair and deserved, but to ban permanently for such a misdemeanor is not worth it.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p><em>[translations via <a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/translator\">DeepL Translate</a>]</em></p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Following his suspension, Koma` apologized and accepted responsibility for the account sharing incident in a public statement.

Dendi started off by saying that he no longer wanted to play in the Eastern Europe (EEU) region, as many players within the region were skeptical about playing with him.</p><p><em>“One of the reasons why I moved to NA was because I don’t want to play in the EEU region anymore. It’s also because I have many people within the region being skeptical, so I had a hard time building a roster in the region. So it’s much easier for me to relocate to different regions like NA or Southeast Asia (SEA) , since many people were so nice to me and it's much easier to build a roster in those regions. Except for EEU that is.”</em></p><p>Dendi also noted that another reason for B8’s relocation to North America was due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Dendi’s native country of Ukraine as he is finding it difficult to operate within an active warzone.</p><p><em>“Another reason why we decided to relocate was due to the ongoing war, we started producing more international-based content instead of Russian-based ones so that we can explore the international market. With that in mind, it sounded reasonable for me to move to NA, SEA or other regions. Additionally, like during the war it’s difficult for us to practice as we were struggling and we lost some of our sponsors.”</em></p><p>Dendi ended by saying that B8’s move to North America could help grow the Dota 2 scene in the region, as the organization’s relocation could help with attracting more investments into the region as well as scouting for up and coming talents.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p><em>[Relevant section begins at 1:56:53]</em></p><p>B8 Esports will be competing in the first division of the NA DPC league for the upcoming season along with the likes of TSM, Shopify Rebellion &amp; Nouns.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\">",

During this session, Insane Arena asked Sid a bunch of questions regarding S8UL Esports’s goals and future plans. Talking about S8UL Esports’ vision, Sid said, “<em>There are a lot of things to do in the coming year. Earlier this year, I made a statement to see what we will achieve in the coming year. It took us only nine months to achieve the things we had planned.”</em></p> <p>S8UL Esports has seen massive success since its inception, and much of it can be attributed to all the hard work done and decisions made by its co-owners, Naman “<strong>MortaL</strong>” Mathur, Animesh “<strong>Thug</strong>” Agarwal, and Lokesh “<strong>Goldy</strong>” Jain.&nbsp;</p> <p><em>“Our plans for the future are huge. Goldy also visited to discuss our plans for the upcoming year, and the plans are huge. Hopefully, we will be successful in all the new things we do in the next year,”</em> said Sid.</p> <p>Insane Arena stated that content creators from overseas are equally trying to capture India’s market to increase their fan base. He asked Sid if any big international YouTubers have reached out to S8UL Esports for a collaboration. Responding to this, Sid said, <em>“These things happen quite frequently. If there was something that we could reveal, we would have revealed it already. I cannot say anything else right now about who has approached us. You might have seen in the past that S8UL Esports has collaborated with notable personalities, like actors and influencers, from outside of the country.”&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Sid explained why actors and influencers come to S8UL Esports for promotion. <em>“Because when they want to come to India, and when they want to promote their product or brand, they know there is no better option than S8UL Esports or its influencers and creators. We have already done this, but I can’t reveal what we are going to do in the future. Obviously, if I could, it would’ve been in the news,” he said.</em></p><p><br>Talking about S8UL Esports' plans for the coming year, Sid said, <em>“But, for sure, there are some plans in the pipeline.

        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>With Respawn gearing up for Apex Legends Season 16 coming in February, players are expecting a lot more from the new season. Season 15 caught a lot of flak for lack of balance changes to Legends which led to a fairly stale meta. However, recent leaks suggest this may have been for a reason. Leaks by YouTuber Thordan Smash suggest that Apex Legend classes are getting major changes in the new season. Here is all we know about the potential upcoming changes to Legend classes in Season 16 of Apex Legends.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Leaks suggest a Pathfinder rework along with a Legend class overhaul</strong></h2><p>YouTuber Thordan Smash tweeted about the new Apex Legend class changes heading to the game for Season 16. he said, <em>“The new classes in Apex Legends have another leaker putting out info about them...and I'm all for it. Pathfinder finally getting a solid rework baby.”</em> He also detailed some of the anticipated changes.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>The legends in the game are divided into four broad categories, namely offensive, defensive, recon and support. According to the leaks, the legends in the offensive or assault class will be divided into a new Skirmisher class which will include high mobility legends like Wraith. Given the class’ description, it is also likely to include legends like Octane and Pathfinder. Pathfinder is also likely to get a rework. Fans of the legend have been asking Respawn to change up his lacklustre kit for a while now. The Assault classes are likely to also get red bins and extra inventory slots for ammo.&nbsp;</p><p>According to leaks, defensive legends are to be classified as Control legends which lock areas down. Respawn seems to want to make a distinction between shield-based lockdowns and more aggressive ways of locking down areas. Although Newcastle can also hold areas down with his ultimate, he and Gibraltar are going to be reclassified as Support. In a <a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/why-does-apex-legends-have-so-few-support-characters\">previous AMA on Reddit</a>,&nbsp; Respawn’s Lead Game Designer, Devan McGuire talked about why Apex has so few legends in the Support class. Apex Legends’s high TTK (time to kill) leads to quick fights and limited opportunities to reset. Respawn doesn’t want to disturb the game’s current TTK so any heal-based support needs to be balanced carefully so as to not make healing and resets too powerful. The reclassification of the Support class will broaden the scope of the role to include both shield, item and heal-based legends.&nbsp;</p><p>Thordan also added, <em>“It also makes sense that LAN is February 2nd now in London, no class changes until February 14th on season 16 so pros aren't impacted until the next split.”</em></p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

The item damages and reveals nearby champions whenever the champion equipping it is immobilized or has immobilized an enemy champion.&nbsp;</p><h3>Item Rework: Randuin’s Omen and Frozen Heart</h3><p>One of the commonly used tank items, Randuins Omen, will get a new passive that allows the champion to heal based on the damage received.</p><p>The Frozen Heart will also force tank players to go aggressive as it will now only apply an attack speed debuff whenever they hit enemies or if enemies attack the champion who has the item.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>ARURF Returns</h2><p>The All Random Ultra Rapid Fire (ARURF) mode will be making a major comeback with a new mechanic for junglers called Execute Smite.

The team plans to initially launch in Malaysia, one of its biggest markets, and then expand to other smaller countries. However, in order to comply with Google Play Store policies, the version of Axie Infinity available on the app store will have limited features and players will not be able to earn tokens, a core aspect of the game. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>The launch on the Google Play Store may expose Axie Infinity to a larger audience, but there is concern that the game's rocky year, including low daily active user numbers and the decline of its governance token, could lead to negative reviews on the app. Despite these challenges, the company behind Axie Infinity will continue to release updates and improvements.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Plans for Axie's Play Store Launch&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The team noted on their <ins><a href=\"https://axie.substack.com/p/googleplaystore\">substack announcement</a></ins> that they plan to first do a soft launch on the Malaysian Playstore to give themselves a \"chance to continue testing and improving the game.\" This isn't surprising given how Malaysia is one of their biggest markets. Just last year, some people in places like Malaysia and the Philippines were <ins><a href=\"https://cilisos.my/axie-infinity-nft-blockchain-smooth-love-potion-slp-ethereum-mavis/?amp\">reportedly</a></ins> earning more from Axie Infinity than their daily jobs. And the majority of their player base came from these Asian countries.</p><p>After the Malaysian launch, the team also plans to launch in other smaller countries that will \"mirror the demographics and player archetypes of regions such as North/South America, Europe, and East Asia.\"</p><p>It is difficult for web3 games to be launched on Apple and Google's app stores because of the companies' policies, such as receiving a commission on in-game purchases. The first version of Axie Infinity on the Google Play Store will have limited features and players will not be able to earn tokens to comply with these policies.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>What does this Launch mean for Axie Infinity?</strong></h2><p>While launching on the Google Play Store will give Axie Infinity a lot more exposure to traditional gamers, many fans on Twitter noted that there may also be negative side effects.</p><p>This year has not been the best for Axie Infinity in terms of both prices and adoption. The game which experienced huge success a few years after launching took a downturn with the rest of the crypto market this year. The number of daily active users has sometimes been reported to be as low as 0 in 24 hours and just 5 in 7 days by DappRadar. This can be attributed to the downfall of the game's governance token, Axie Infinity Shards (AXS), which has left a lot of gamers disenchanted with the game.</p><p><br>Many have noted on social media that a lot of these disenchanted players, many of whom have lost hundreds of dollars previously investing in in-game assets, might spur a wave of negative reviews on the app. A Twitter user, <ins><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ExnalPH/status/1519298913089769473?t=-uYL6NNUywW5L_sH1tE_Yw&amp;s=19\">@ExnalPH</a></ins>, noted that a flood of negative reviews from players like these \"could halt the mainstream adoption train before it even starts.\"</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Despite the game's rocky year, the company behind Axie Infinity, Sky Mavis, has remained hard at work, releasing numerous updates and improvements. While there's still a long road of recovery and uncertainty for the game, updates like these and many others like the launch of Axie Core may help drive adoption for the game in the future. And it remains to see how the Google Play Store Launch will help drive organic adoption since there will be no option for players to earn and the game will be judged mainly by its ability to be fun and exciting.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\">",

However, leaks have suggested that Apex Legends Season 16 might be the first season in the game’s history to not have a new legend release.

She discussed the challenges with Indian tournament organizers (TOs) including issues with processing payment, a gender pay gap, sexism, and more. Zahk also mentioned that these issues were a major factor in her decision to stop working in India.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Zahk speaks up about gender pay gap, sexism, and more in the Indian Valorant esports ecosystem</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/zahkriiven/status/1605494335998509056\">According to </a><ins><a href=\"https://twitter.com/zahkriiven/status/1605494335998509056\">Zahk</a></ins>, TOs exploit new casters horribly by underpaying them. <em>“The first ever gig I got, I was expected to cast six games a day, nine games on Sunday, almost daily. For this, I was offered ₹12k INR ($145 USD) a month. People told me I should be grateful to get what I got seeing they started working for free but that doesn’t make it fair. At the end of the day, someone is still working for you, and exposure doesn’t pay the bills,”</em> she said.<em>&nbsp;</em><br></p><p>Zahk claimed that TOs also do not pay their casters on time, and that casters had to reach out to TOs multiple times to clear the dues. <em>“They don’t respond, don’t take calls, and only pay what they owe after months. I still haven’t been paid for an event I did in August for a particular TO, and it’s a pretty negligible sum (₹5k&lt;). I’ve reached out to the TO multiple times and only after asking twice do I get a reply saying it hasn’t even been internally processed,” </em>she added. <em>“I had several caster friends who suffered because their payment did not come through for months.”</em></p> <p>Following this, Zahk talked about the double standards and sexism she encountered during her caster journey.<em> “As a woman, my clothing choices are far more criticized and policed than others. Recently at a gig, I was told the attire was formal. I was wearing a collared shirt over a t-shirt. My male co-caster was wearing a casual t-shirt, without even a collar. I was told to wear something more formal/button up until the collar. My co-caster did not get any comments or similar feedback.”</em> She revealed that she was told to “shut up” when she pointed this out.</p> <p>Zahk also talked about the unfair pay scale and gender pay gap she had to face. <em>“After some experience with VCT APAC GC (Valorant Champions Tour: Game Changers Asia-Pacific ), I was hired for an event at ₹500 a map and told that that was the budget for the event and that’s all they could do. This was less than a quarter of what I usually get abroad but I was ok working with the TO since it was a women’s event which generally has lower budgets here. I came to know they were paying my co-caster twice that.”</em></p><p><br>Following this, she stated that the next time she worked with the same TO, her co-caster was making ₹1.2k, whereas she was making ₹600. <em>“I have been consistently low balled by TOs and only been hired at atrociously low prices,”</em> she said.<em> “My male co-casters have consistently gotten 2x to 3x times more what I’ve gotten, if not more. People with less experience casting Valorant who merely read the killfeed get more cause they’re friends with the TOs.”</em> She mentioned that this is one of the main reasons why she stopped working in India and moved abroad.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Zahk talks about cronyism in the industry</strong></h2><p>Zahk stated that many tournament organizers in India hire their friends as casters, even if they are not knowledgeable about the game or have poor streaming quality and delays.<em>“How are we supposed to improve if there’s no drive to do better and no criticism? I’m not saying folks should be perfect but at least talk about it? I’ve been open about my experiences at certain events which have gotten me blacklisted despite my skill and experience.

        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Riot Games has implemented measures to address the issue of \"smurfing\" in Valorant, according to a recent <a href=\"https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/dev/valorant-systems-health-series-map-diversity/\">blog post</a> from Insights Manager Brian Change. The company introduced Automated Smurf Detection to adjust the matchmaking ratings (MMR) of smurf accounts and has seen a reduction in matches with smurfs as a result. Additionally, changes to the rules for forming a group of five players (known as a \"five-stack\") have also contributed to a decrease in smurf activity. These efforts are part of Riot Games' ongoing efforts to address smurfing and ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for all players.</p><p>Riot Games said, “<em>Overall, smurf counts are down ~17% compared to earlier in the year, and newly created smurfs are getting to their ‘correct’ MMR 2–3 times faster. More improvements and additions are planned in 2023!</em>” Further, the company looked closely at the reasons why players opt for smurfing. Riot also noted that it is working on different plays to aid players to play with their friends and noted that the Premier mode is a step in that direction.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>What has Riot Games done to combat smurfing so far?</h2><p>Riot Games noted that its Automated Smurf Detection was working well and that it saw similar improvements in the percentage of stomp matches. After running a bunch of experiments in North America and globally, Riot officially launched smurf detection worldwide to all regions in September. In fact, it also attributed the reduction in smurfing to the five-stack changes it introduced. “<em>While there wasn’t a major difference in the rate at which 5-stacks were participating in Competitive, there was a significant shift in the makeup of those 5-stacks. A large number of 5-stacks today are ones that would not have been able to play together before the changes in Patch 3.10,</em>” said Riot. Five-stacking plays an important role since playing with friends is one of the reasons for smurfing.&nbsp;</p><p>It also noted that five-stack competitive matches still remained fair and did not produce a downward shift. “<em>Today, over a third of all 5-stack matches end in a 13-10 or closer. 5-stack matches are actually closer in score than any other match in Competitive,</em>” noted Riot.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>What’s cooking at Riot Games for the future?</h2><p>Firstly, Riot Games acknowledged that more improvements and additions to its smurf detection methodology can be done and added that it will ramp up its efforts to detect and act against boosting, account sharing and account purchasing. It is also exploring additional ways for players of varying skill levels to play Valorant competitively together.&nbsp;</p><p>Riot hoped that its upcoming Premier mode will be an avenue for players to play socially without feeling the need to create secondary accounts or go smurfing. The Alpha test of Premier mode was announced on 26th October and this will provide a well-planned tournament system for dedicated teams who want to take their skills to the next level.&nbsp;</p><p>The company addressed challenge-hungry players and stated that it wanted to build a connection between the game and its esports setup through a highly competitive mode that will enable players to experience Valorant in a similar way that pros and teams do.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#7EC623;border-left:10px solid #7EC623\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/valorant-premier-mode-all-you-need-to-know\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Valorant Premier Mode - All You Need to Know </a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

Two weeks have passed since these changes were introduced and most players are unhappy and continue to voice their issues with these changes added to the ARAM mode.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Players are not excited about ARAM anymore</h2><p>To those unfamiliar with ARAM, players are given random champions from the available champion pool and will able to trade or reroll their picks. The game mode still features 5v5 combat and there’s only one lane (middle) in the mode.&nbsp;</p><p>A majority of the League of Legends community feels like the changes to ARAM only make the mode competitive instead of making it fun and entertaining. Multiple players on social media have been voicing their disappointment, especially about the falling towers.&nbsp;</p><p>One Redditor <ins><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/zq27jg/if_the_fallen_towers_are_staying_in_aram_we/\">wrote</a></ins>, “<em>These changes [falling towers] vastly reduced the amount of available space to move and fight around and all that's done is catapult Teemo and Shaco from ‘obnoxious’ tier all the way up to ‘if you fall behind you permanently stay behind’ tier.</em>” The user noted that there is no way that a single cannon wave, which works as Oracle’s Extract, is going to be enough to clear all of the Teemo shrooms and Shaco boxes on the map.</p><p>A comment on the thread felt that there should be a narrow gap at the end of the fallen towers so that champions can move around them. The problem with the falling towers is that they block the entirety of the lane and players have to use the other half of the lane to push or defend against enemies. This also acts as terrain and champions like Ornn, Teemo, Shaco, or Anivia can use the falling towers to their advantage.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Another Redditor <ins><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/zf8f7f/new_aram_is_proof_that_riot_never_learned_from/\">said</a></ins>, “<em>With the extra bush added and destroyed towers creating a permanent obstruction in the lane, the map feels very congested for the losing team and full control for the winning team. Blocking off almost half the lane while surrounding that remaining open path makes the losing team feel cornered every time they try to start or answer a teamfight.</em>”</p><p>Early in November when the ARAM changes went live on the Public Beta Environment, a player asked why Riot Games has not considered making the towers fall in different directions instead of just one. Replying to this, Lead Modes Designer Daniel “<strong>Maxw3ll</strong>” Emmons <ins><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/yv9vdn/comment/iwdn67l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">said</a></ins>, “<em>We tried it falling at various angles but unless it restricted player movement in this way the terrain just wasn't changing up the game. Most of the movement on Howling Abyss is towards or away from the Nexuses (Nexii?). Falling in the middle or at an angle didn't really create cool vision plays you could make.</em>”</p><p>While the majority of the player base feels negative about the falling towers and the new ARAM terrain, the chances of Riot Games reverting these ARAM changes are pretty low.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#7EC623;border-left:10px solid #7EC623\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/guide/league-of-legends-season-13-patch-schedule-for-2023\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">League of Legends Season 13 Patch Schedule for 2023</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

The subscription service offers players in-game goodies every month. One of the core components of Prime Gaming, which is a free subscription to a streamer of your choice on Twitch, is missing which makes the launch of the service a little disappointing for fans.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>The lack of a Twitch subscription makes Prime Gaming less than appealing in India</h2><p>Twitch subscriptions in India used to cost $5 USD for years before regional pricing was implemented. This brought down the cost of a monthly subscription to 110 INR ($1.5 USD). A lot of creators were shielded from regional pricing by Twitch but after the first three months since regional pricing was introduced, creators now receive less money based on the regional pricing of subscriptions.</p><p>With Twitch Prime, regional pricing is not implemented and streamers receive a fixed amount of money regardless of which region they receive a subscription from. But with Twitch subscriptions not being included in the Indian version of Prime Gaming, players in the country will continue to have to pay 110 INR for each subscription and streamers will continue to get paid less because of it, which also affects local creators.</p><p>Fans on social media are attributing the lack of free Twitch subs to the price of Prime Gaming to its low price of 1,499 INR ($18 USD). Many feel that Prime Gaming with free Twitch subs being offered as a separate package would be a great addition instead of removing one of the core aspects of the gaming service.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>How to sign-up for Prime Gaming in India</h2><p>You can currently purchase Prime membership at an offer price by paying 179 INR for a month, 459 INR for 3 months, or 1,499 INR per year.

Additionally, Fishman was supporting his offlaner leaving Gorgc to fend for himself in the early stages of the game as Gorgc said he was fine laning alone earlier in the game.</p><p>While Fishman did not want anything to do with Gorgc during the game as he was busy supporting his offlaner, Gorgc replied in anger saying that they could have won the lane if Fishman didn't leave him alone.</p><p><em>“I don’t understand why you keep TP’ing top. I was 3K net worth and he was half and then you left the lane. You ****ing dumbass. Shut up. Don’t use my name, you *****ing dog.

Popular community figure &amp; B8’s captain Danil <strong>\"Dendi '' </strong>Ishutin tried to diffuse the situation by calming them down as he was also in the game as their teammate. Gorgc then went on to insult Fishman by mentioning his family.<br><br><em>“How can I chill if you’re not ***ing flaming? Like, look at your mother.

        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>While Dota 2 is essentially a team game, there are some aspects where you cannot help but stand out to certain players. This includes laning, with many players excelling at outperforming their opponents in the early stages. During the 'Fly and the Other Guy' podcast, Shopify Rebellion's captain Tal \"<strong>Fly</strong>\" Aizik discussed the top five hardest Dota 2 laners he has faced. Fly included former teammate Daryl \"<strong>iceiceice</strong>\" Koh on his list, as well as offlane duos. Considering Fly’s extensive experience as a support player, the number one spot on the veteran's list, a midlaner, was a surprising one. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Fly says SumaiL is the hardest Dota 2 laner</h2><p>Fly had his former Evil Geniuses teammate iceiceice at number five on the list of the hardest laners in Dota 2. The only word he used to describe iceiceice in the laning stage was <em>\"annoying.\"</em> </p><p><em>“So, for number five, I have my good buddy iceiceice. And I will give a special shoutout to DJ because that lane, in particular, was very annoying. And this is basically what classifies iceiciece. He is annoying. He is an annoying person to lane against. I definitely think the way he played, especially years ago, was probably stronger because people didn't know Dota as much. His goal in the lane - he would come to the lane and he would always choose to annoy you over having a good game for himself if he has the choice.”</em></p><p>Denying an allied creep rather than last-hitting it, blocking neutral camps with summons, and pulling waves for a longer period than other offlaners were some of the plays that iceiceice constantly did which made him frustrating to lane against, Fly said.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>The fourth player on Fly's list was the up-and-coming offlane-turned-carry player Ammar \"<strong>ATF</strong>\" Al-Assaf. In his opinion, ATF is a very lethal player because of the patience with which he plays the lanes.</p><p><em>“On number four, I have ATF. His trait is that he is very patient. He doesn’t care if you are hitting him or you are trying to harass him, he seems very calm. He doesn’t let that get to him. He plays for his timing. He last hits really well. He’s very very mechanically skilled in terms of how to maneuver the lane around.”</em></p><p>In many matchups, Fly discussed how ATF can opt for unconventional item builds such as four Bracers just to gain an edge and control the lane.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p><em>[relevant section begins at 14:50]</em></p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>The offlane duo of Tundra Esports' The International 11 (TI11) winners, Neta \"<strong>33</strong>\" Shapira and Martin \"<strong>Saksa</strong>\" Sazdov, were third on Fly’s list. </p><p><em>“So, my third person is gonna be a combo and it’s gonna be 33 and Saksa. So, the characteristic of these guys is that they are the game-plan team. So, okay, they have a plan, they always have some idea of how they are gonna play the game.”</em></p><p>33 knows what he wants to accomplish with his heroes and Saksa makes the process easier by punishing enemy mistakes aggressively. Fly said that while they are both skilled players individually, they are among the best offlane duos and were the best at TI11.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>TI10 champions Magomed \"<strong>Collapse</strong>\" Khalilov and Miroslaw \"<strong>Mira</strong>\" Kolpakov were second on Fly's list as he opted for another offlane duo. One of the few lanes that he and Artour \"<strong>Arteezy</strong>\" Babaev had trouble playing was against Collapse and Mira. </p><p><em>“Number two on my list is going to be another duo, another pair. These guys are Collapse and Mira, however, I specifically noted TI10, the one they won. We scrimmed against them a good amount of times and the way I described them is that they had the killer instinct. So, they were the most punishing offlane duo by far.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>In Fly's Dota 2 career, Syed \"<strong>SumaiL</strong>\" Hassan from Nigma Galaxy has been the toughest laner he's faced. Despite not having directly competed against SumaiL much in a lane, Fly still placed him on his top list because of a ranked game experience four years ago. </p><p><em>“So my number one - the hardest person to lane against is SumaiL. I remember a pub a few years ago where I was forced to go mid and I was against SumaiL and I got absolutely massacred. I have never felt that before. The amount of pressure I felt, it was horrible. This was around TI8. I classify him as the king, the king of the midlane. I am serious, this guy is absolutely insane at laning.”</em></p><p>Fly could not single out a particular aspect of SumaiL's play, saying that he was impeccable for having killer instincts, planning, patience, etc. Even when Fly played against him in the sidelane when SumaiL was a carry, he said the skills were excellent.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Out of all these players, Fly will not have to face any of them in the upcoming North American (NA) Dota Pro Circuit (DPC) Winter Tour with them playing in either Europe or Southeast Asia. In January 2023, Fly will make his Shopify Rebellion debut in the NA DPC Winter Tour. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#E7362B;border-left:10px solid #E7362B\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/fly-names-his-all-star-dota-2-team\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fly Names His All-Star Dota 2 Team</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\">",

        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Ten Dota 2 players have been permanently banned by Valve for account sharing and impersonating members of other teams during tournaments. The Eastern European (EEU) audience has been particularly drawn to this issue, as all ten players hail from the region. Entity's captain, Dzmitry \"<strong>Fishman</strong>\" Palishchuk, also commented on this on Telegram. Fishman said that though he did not know each player's specific situation, he surmised that at least some of the players may have had internet issues and as a result, gave their accounts to others so that their teams would not be let down during games. In addition, he has heard that some of them have engaged in match fixing, and there may be more permanent bans to come.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Fishman shares his thoughts on ten Dota 2 players getting Valve banned</h2><p>There is a sense of shock among the community after news broke that ten players have seen the banhammer from Valve, and Fishman expressed a similar feeling. </p><p>He emphasized the situation with Virtus.pro specifically whose carry player Kamil \"<strong>Koma`</strong>\" Biktimirov (also known as \"agressive child\") is among the players banned, saying the team will now need to find a new player.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p><em>“Holy crap, this news - I'm in the ***, to be honest. Can you imagine, VP has carry, and now they don't have a carry? So what do we do? All the carries are busy, the man is banned. I understand if you got stuck during the official game... You're like, \"I gotta give my friend his account so he can finish the game so I don't screw up the team.\" And then, bam, you get banned for life. Anlaki. I don't know if it was just this case or others. But it is, of course, very harsh.”</em></p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Fishman also speculated on who will take over as Virtus.pro's carry player, now that Koma` has been banned. <em>“So is Cooman the new Virtus.pro player now? And who else? I wonder if Cooman even wants to play competitively. Oh yes, iLTW is also a free agent,”</em> he said.</p><p>At the same time, there is even uncertainty about Virtus.pro competing in the upcoming Dota Pro Circuit (DPC) Winter Tour due to its roster being locked with Koma`. In the event that Valve allows Virtus.pro to change its carry, it will be making an exception. Koma's violation most likely occurred before he joined the team.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Fishman also said that he heard some of the players engaging in 322 (a term used for intentionally throwing a game). <em>“Actually, I won't say the nicknames, but I've heard from other guys that half of these nicknames I've read are 322-eers. I can't confirm it, I just heard it.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>A separate Telegram post from Fishman expressed a stronger belief that these players engaged in match fixing because account sharing alone would not have got them banned. As he had heard, there were also more bans on the way. </p><p><em>“I already figured it out: all these guys who got banned, they're all 322-eers. Some of them were still playing with the software. They banned them for a reason. They say there will be a second wave of bans. Every one of these guys is a 322-eer. People wouldn't be banned if the account was transferred from one to the other.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p><em>[transcriptions via <a href=\"https://www.cybersport.ru/tags/dota-2/fishman-ia-tak-ponimaiu-esli-vykliuchilsia-internet-i-daesh-akkaunt-drugu-chtoby-ne-podvodit-komandu-tebia-baniat-na-vsiu-zhizn\">cybersports.ru</a>, <a href=\"https://dota2.net/news/79195-fishman-govoryat-chto-budet-eshche-vtoraya-volna-banov\">dota2.net</a>, translations via <a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/translator\">DeepL Translate</a>]</em></p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>While match fixing has been a major factor in Valve's permanent bans of Dota 2 pros, <a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/team-orca-has-been-disqualified-from-dpc-sea-202122-division-2\">some players were also indefinitely banned earlier this year for account sharing.</a> As history suggests, Valve used to enforce only partial bans for this activity. </p><p>Many of the 10 banned players were just starting out in Dota 2, and it's a shame their careers ended prematurely.

The two companies had previously signed a seven-year agreement for FTX to be the official cryptocurrency sponsor for the League of Legends Championship Series (LCS). However, FTX filing for bankruptcy earlier this year and has only paid half of the agreed-upon $12.5 Million USD to Riot Games in the 2022 calendar year, according to <ins><a href=\"https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DocketInfo\">documents</a></ins> submitted by Riot Games to the bankruptcy court.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>FTX is yet to pay Riot Games its due for the 2022 calendar year&nbsp;</h2><p>FTX had also partnered with esports organization TSM. TSM and FTX entered a partnership where FTX invested $210 Million USD as part of a 10-year deal between the esports team and the crypto exchange. TSM released an official statement addressing FTX’s bankruptcy and the organization revealed that it is not aware of what led to its investor’s bankruptcy aside from publicly known information.</p><p>With 2023 right around the corner, FTX owes its first payment to Riot Games for the next calendar year on 3rd January 2023. If the deal went smoothly, Riot and FTX would be partnered until the 2018 LCS season.

FTX cannot turn back the clock and undo the damage inflicted on Riot in the wake of its collapse.”</p><p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, was arrested in The Bahamas earlier this week. He was accused of playing League of Legends during company meetings. Riot Games revealed in the court documents that its image is “inextricably linked” with FTX and Sam-Bankman Fried due to his love of League of Legends.&nbsp;</p><p>The first hearing for Riot Games’ lawsuit against FTX will commence on 11th January 2023.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#7EC623;border-left:10px solid #7EC623\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/tsm-denies-report-of-it-entering-dota-2-to-please-ftx\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TSM Denies Report of It Entering Dota 2 to Please FTX</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

Starting next year, the LCS will run on Thursday and Friday every week with matches starting at 12 pm PT, noted Riot Games. However, fans are not entirely convinced by this move and are raising several questions. They pointed out that the times are more Europe-friendly rather than favoring North American (NA) viewers. The biggest drawback of having LCS matches on weekdays at noon is that people going to school, university, or work will likely miss these games. LCS fans and even some of the prominent personalities in the LCS community including Isaac Azael Cummings Bentley voiced their fears.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>What does the community think about the LCS schedule changes?</h2><p>One LCS fan took to the <ins><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/zmtax6/the_changes_to_the_lcs_broadcast_time_are/\">League of Legends subreddit to write</a></ins>, “<em>The changes to the LCS broadcast time are objectively bad and potentially damaging to viewership.</em>” The Redditor explained that there are obvious problems like the games starting in the middle of the day and towards the end of the week when most of the workforce is the busiest. The user added, “<em>Most people aren't going to be able to just watch it at work if they have a desk job, and it certainly won't happen for anyone working any kind of labor job. Second, most people won't be able to attend in person.</em>”&nbsp; They also pointed out that if the LCS’ goal was to cater to a younger audience, the change will do the exact opposite since school hours are typically between 7 am to 3-5 pm.&nbsp;</p><p>Another user simply commented, “<em>Lunchbreak Championship Series</em>,” jokingly hinting at the LCS’ new timings. A college-going user <ins><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/zmtax6/comment/j0doxwb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">commented</a></ins> on the thread, “<em>I'm 4th year in college, and I hate that now LCS is in the middle of the day during the week.

He noted that LCS moving to the weekdays is scary and that he raised a ton of concerns internally. Azael added, “<em>It's one that makes me worried for the future of the league that I love, and for my career as an LCS caster. I was left with a lot of questions about what will happen to the LCS next.”</em></p><p>Though he acknowledged that there is data showing as many or even more viewers in some cases are watching Twitch on weekdays, he questioned how this would apply to the LCS audience. Azael said, “<em>Much love to all the LCS fans, and know that many of us share the same concerns you have. We're seeing &amp; reading everything people are saying online, and it really sucks to know lots of fans I've personally made connections with won't be able to watch live anymore.</em>”</p><p>On the same note, esports personality <ins><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TravisGafford/status/1603662822163894273?s=20&amp;t=OmU0v5uV-hEszHrdlipzpw\">Travis Gafford questioned</a></ins>, “<em>Man, is there anyone outside of Riot that believes in these 12 pm start times?

The deal will go into effect in March 2023 and the new format will split up the competitive scene into nine regions. While Rainbow Six esports might not be as popular as other shooters like CS:GO, Valorant, and Apex Legends, it continues to deliver a fleshed-out esports circuit to anyone who wants to compete in the game. The goal of the new circuit is to showcase more high-profile games while also developing a better open competition format for new teams.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>The Rainbow Six Major format is being overhauled&nbsp;</h2><p>With the number of regions going up to nine, the Rainbow Six Majors will have a brand-new format.

This applies to both Stage One and Stage Two, and the format is doing away with a Last Chance Qualifier event.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Teams will have to pull off consistent performances throughout the year as points accumulated in each competitive year are what will determine entry into future Six Invitational events.

Immortals coach Gabriel <strong>“Invert”</strong> Zoltan-Johan decided to start the non-profit trade association to provide legal resources and training opportunities and advocate for LCS and North American Collegiate League (NACL) coaches.</p><h2><strong>How will the Esports Coaches Guild work?</strong></h2><p>According to Zoltan-Johan, membership for the association is open to all coaches, not just professional ones. “<em>Whether you’re in high school, collegiate, the NACL or the LCS, you’re welcome and encouraged to participate</em>,” said the former FlyQuest coach. The Esports Coaches Guild offers three tiers of annual memberships, namely a $300, $400 and $500 tier. Members get access to a number of courses offered by the EGC including EPA courses, legal workshops, conferences, summits, contract reviews, access to salary transparency, online and offline events, Discord and more. Each tier is geared towards a different level of experience. The $300 tier is intended for coaches who are just starting out and the higher tiers feature more intermediate courses and involvement. Here is the announcement video released by the ECG featuring Zoltan-Johan:</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Zoltan-Johan told the <a href=\"https://www.jacobwolf.report/p/professional-league-of-legends-coach\">Jacob Wolf Report</a>, “<em>Having an equivalent [to the Players Association] for coaches and competitive staff, I find to be pretty important because the job itself has comparatively low job security, coaches don't often have many rights, and often a lot of coaches are not represented by any sort of legal team or agent just because of potential conflict of interests that occur.</em>”  He expects 70 to 75 coaches in the LCS and NACL to join the ECG. The organisation is currently in talks with Riot Games to make the ECG the advocacy body for NACL and LCS coaches with respect to rules, policies and compliances for those leagues. </p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div data-ref=\"vm-preloader\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 300px; min-width: 300px; height: 250px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 0px auto;\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\" data-pos=\"1002\" id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391-1002\" data-reg=\"true\"></div></div></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-esports\">",

It is possible that last season's result influenced this departure, but the reasons for this bold move remain unknown. The former position four of Evil Geniuses, Andreas \"<strong>Cr1t-</strong>\" Nielsen, revealed on a recent livestream why they are no longer playing for the team. Cr1t- stated that Evil Geniuses was unwilling to pay the salaries that he and his team wanted, and instead wanted a lower-paid roster. Meanwhile, the player also mentioned that the organization had overpaid them in the past. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Cr1t- said that Evil Geniuses parted ways with them because of salary-related issues</h2><p>Cr1t- went on to discuss the matter of salaries in relation to the departure of the old Evil Geniuses roster. This roster featured Cr1t-, Artour \"<strong>Arteezy</strong>\" Babaev, Tal \"<strong>Fly</strong>\" Aizik, Abed \"<strong>Abed</strong>\" Yusop, and Egor \"<strong>Nightfall</strong>\" Grigorenko.</p><p>Despite parting ways, he clarified that there were no hard feelings involved in the decision.</p><p><em>“The reason why we are not with EG is because they didn’t want to pay our salaries… EG just wanted a cheap roster and wanted to play like - that’s fair. There’s no hard feeling. We definitely were overpaid on EG and EG always took good care of us.”</em></p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>As Cr1t- explained, during the peak days of the pandemic, Evil Geniuses continued to support them despite other teams not actively paying the players' salaries.</p><p><em>\"During all of COVID, when it was really hard for us to compete because we had global players, we couldn’t really compete in all the EU tournaments and stuff, EG still paid our salaries, and a lot of companies were like - not paying salaries for people who were inactive. So, they didn’t have to do it, you know. I still have a lot of respect for EG. Not going to change.”</em></p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Cr1t- was an integral member of Evil Geniuses for six years and witnessed the ups and downs of the team during his time with the organization. Following this move, he has now joined Shopify Rebellion with the other former teammates, with the exception of Nightfall as he returned to Eastern Europe. Following the acquisition of Evil Geniuses' slot, Shopify Rebellion will play in Division 1 of the North American Dota Pro Circuit (DPC) 2023.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#E7362B;border-left:10px solid #E7362B\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/dota2/news/shopify-rebellion-acquires-ex-eg-roster-as-it-announces-its-entry-into-dota-2\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify Rebellion Acquires Ex-EG Roster as It Announces Its Entry Into Dota 2</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-dota2\">",

He started off by talking about the former support duo of Daniyal <strong>\"yamich\"</strong> Lazebnyy &amp; Egor <strong>\"Xakoda\" </strong>Lipartiya, as he gave his reasoning behind the duo’s departure from the roster.</p><p><em>“Let's start with Xakoda and yamich, two young promising players. We picked sayuw instead of yamich because he fits this lineup better. Also, me and Timur [coach] were working with sayuw for quite a while. We knew exactly what to expect from him, and it looked like the best option. As for Xakoda, he was just unlucky. Xakoda is a young player but not captain-material yet.”</em></p><p>He then spoke about the departure of Danil <strong>\"gpk\"</strong> Skutin &amp; Dmitry<strong> \"DM\"</strong> Dorokhin. He first pointed out that he wanted both gpk &amp; DM to stay with the team for the upcoming season. However, both players decided that it was best to pursue other opportunities in different teams.</p><p><em>“And in this reshuffle, many clubs were fighting over prospective players, including DM and gpk. Of course, we would like to work with gpk? Who wouldn't like to work with him? No doubt - he is a mid laner of the prodigy generation, as it is called. He was in VP for a long time, and we respect his decision. As for DM, he is a great guy. I would work gladly with him, too. But he got that European [OG] offer. It's an important factor these days; many leave for Europe to play in multilanguage teams. That was when we realized we have to assemble a new roster.``</em></p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Virtus.pro will play in Division 1 of the first regional league of the EEU DPC (Eastern European Dota Pro Circuit) 2022-23.

The game is being developed by Animoca Brands and Lympo (Animoca Brands’ subsidiary company) in partnership with Play Magnus Group, World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen’s company.

WeMade is best known in the Web3 gaming space for Mir4, a play-to-earn Web3 game based on the popular ‘Legend of Mir Series,’ that lets you mint your character as an NFT, and even mine cryptocurrency if you so choose. The participation of Microsoft in this round follows the comment made by Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Games and Xbox who said that Metaverse today is a ‘poorly built video game’ in October 2022. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Microsoft's Investment in WeMade Could Potentially See it Explode in Popularity</h2><p>WeMade was founded in 2000 by Kwan Ho Park and has made several games over the past couple of decades including the popular ‘Legend of Mir’ series, Fishing Strike and Icarus. Over the last few years, the company has grown exponentially by working in several verticals that include online game development, publishing, IP, licensing and investment.</p><p>The company has a wide presence in the Asian regions especially in Korea and China, especially thanks to the ‘Legend of Mir’ IP that it owns with Actoz.</p><p>Recently, the company in March signed a strategic partnership MoU with Gamechanger to enable P-2-E games to South-east Asia and Latin America. This partnership would mean that parties like Ubisoft may be involved in the partnership through its connection with Gamechanger.</p><p>The gaming company is currently working on the game titled ‘Legend of Ymir’ which is part of the Legend of Mir series and it is being made with Epic Games’ new Unreal Engine 5. </p><p>Legend of Ymir is expected to portray the story of Legend of MIR, reinterpreting it for the Western European audience.

The decline in the value of $AXS coupled with a decline in the active users of Axie Infinity has raised a lot of eyebrows.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>The decline in the value of $AXS</h2><p>As of 24th October, AXS has lost 22% of its value and has been incurring the most losses in comparison to some of the other leading cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The market capitalization has gone down to $890 Million USD from $1.13 Billion USD. As per the <a href=\"https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/axs/allocations-and-unlock/private-sale\">whitepaper</a> given by the company, 2.16 Million AXS tokens out of 21.543 million AXS tokens will be given to Axie’s private investors. COO of Axie Infinity and Sky Mavis, Aleksander Leonard Larsen <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/112724/axie-infinity-drops-week-fears-token-unlock\">reportedly said</a>, \"<em>[Sky Mavis] will not be selling a single token</em>” of the the unlock. </p><p>Some of the locked AXS Tokens (worth $200 Million USD) were released to the early investors. The scheduled unlock was subject to scrutiny by crypto traders who predicted that the unlock would lead to the reduction of the token valuation as early holders of the tokens were most likely to dump the tokens.</p><p>The current valuation of Axie Infinity (as of 31st October) is $9.21 USD which is 90% lower than the previous all-time high of $164.90 USD.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Downward surge of active players - Reason for decline in $AXS value?</h2><p>Axie Infinity has incentivized players to spend more time playing. It even catered to the livelihood of several people who were taken out of their jobs during the pandemic. However, the drop in the value from its all-time high of $164.90 USD per token to  the low $9 per USD token has brought in a lot of skepticism about its viability in the long run.</p><p>The dip in the player count coupled with a surge in the bear market may have been some of the major reasons for the reduction in the valuation of the tokens.</p><p>The developers and the team in Sky Mavis have been facing several challenges in 2022. In February 2022, the Economic Balancing Update lowered the daily earnings of players by removing SLP rewards after clearing adventure mode and daily quests. In March, $600 Million USD were stolen from the Ronin Network after it got hacked.The Ronin Network is the blockchain network that supported Axie Infinity. The active player count declined from an all-time high of 2.7 Million to less than a million as of May 2022.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#243cea;border-left:10px solid #243cea\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/blockchaingames/guide/list-of-axie-infinity-origin-battle-v3-cards\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">List of Axie Infinity: Origin (Battle V3) Cards</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\">",

        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Tech Live (Conference) 2022 saw the participation of eminent personalities from the tech and entertainment industry between 24th October and 26th October. Most of them were asked to describe the metaverse in just one line and their answers elicited mixed reactions. Comparisons were drawn between the metaverse and traditional video gaming by the \"metaverse skeptics.\" </p><p>In reponse, Microsoft Gaming CEO and Head of XBOX Phil Spencer&nbsp;called the metaverse a “<em>poorly built video game,\"</em> and added, “<em>building a metaverse that’s like a living room is not how I want to spend my time.</em>” </p><p>According to the metaverse skeptics, the need for metaverse could be too early for this generation. Concurring, Bob Chapek, CEO of Walt Disney, opined that the metaverse is meant for “<em>the next generation storytelling.</em>”</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Drawing <strong>comparisons</strong> between the metaverse and traditional games</h2><p>One of the most interesting discussions that took place at the conference was the dynamics between gaming and the metaverse. In a video posted by the WSJ, event host Zoe Thomas asked if the metaverse was meant for gamers given that interactions happen online and also because of the inclusion of different characters. Answering this question, Improbable’s CEO Herman Narula clearly stated that the metaverse is not meant for gamers.</p><p>“<em>I don’t think it is. Video games already work well. Video Games are great closed systems of value. If you enjoy Call of Duty or World of Warcraft, they are going to keep on being fun for years to come. The metaverse is the idea, at least in my view, that you can start connecting these experiences together and that’s a lot less interesting to game companies than it is to say sports leagues or fashion brands,</em>\" added Narula.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Similarly, Phil Spencer also compared the relevance of metaverse with video games. Praising video games, he stated that they brought people together “<em>in 3D spaces to go and save the world from invading aliens or conquer the castle,</em>” and reinstated that he does not want to spend time building a metaverse that looks like a living room.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast to the ‘skeptics’, Activate CEO Michael J Wolfe believed that the metaverse would lead to a technology paradigm. He said that games are <em>“proto metaverse”</em> and showed the example of the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, a game where the developers managed to create a digital twin of Amsterdam.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Is </strong>Augmented Reality here to stay?</h2><p>At the WSJ Tech Live conference 2022, Snap’s Co-Founder and CEO Evan Spiegel said, “<em>There’s one group who likes to stay in a computer and there’s a group you know like us that are really focused on augmented reality which is really about harnessing the power of computing while getting it out of the way.</em>” He added that Augmented Reality (AR) “<em>does away with the friction of enjoying the world</em>” which&nbsp;is contrary to what Virtual Reality (VR) offers.&nbsp;</p><p>In another video posted by WSJ, one of its correspondents can be seen spending a day in the metaverse using an oculus. She said she sees potential in the metaverse despite it being in its early days.</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Horizon Worlds: A problem to Meta’s VR vision</h2><p>Palmer Lucky, the founder of Andruil Industries and the creator of Oculus, when asked about the viability of Horizon Worlds stated, “<em>Mark Zuckerberg is the No. 1 VR fan in the entire world. He is putting more money and more time into it than anyone has ever done in history</em>.” He then added that Horizon Worlds is “<em>not fun, it is not good,</em>” talking about whether it is worthwhile, and called it a \"<em>project car.</em>\" </p><p>Notably, in August, Mark Zuckerberg’s selfie in Horizon Worlds with the digital versions of France’s Eiffel Tower and Spain’s La Sagrada Familia faced a lot of criticism due to the use of ‘low’ quality graphics. It was also compared to the video games that are in the market currently.</p><p>The insights brought by these tech moguls could perhaps be true. But one cannot deny the immense growth and investments that the metaverse or the VR space has garnered over time. Only time will tell if the metaverse will be attractive enough to bring more people into immersive reality and eventually replace traditional games.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#243cea;border-left:10px solid #243cea\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/blockchaingames/news/the-university-of-tokyo-gears-up-to-offer-courses-on-metaverse\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The University of Tokyo Gears up to Offer Courses on Metaverse</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\">",

Instead it plans on slowly building its way to the top, <em>\"working in tandem with a yet-to-be-appointed General Manager on finding talent and setting up the right infrastructure for the team.\"</em></p><p>However, TSM plans on assembling its mixed cast of rookie and established players from Europe. The decision was met with some criticism, but Kallas defended this move by giving the following two key reasons:</p><ol><li><p>This move further bolsters TSM's move to increase its global presence, having already ventured into the Japanese, Indian, and Brazilian markets.</p> </li><li><p>As CS:GO is mainly focussed in Europe, constantly producing the best players in the game, TSM wants to be a part of the strongest region.</p> <p><em>\"It’s like, if we’re going to be in an esport, let’s find a way to win world championships. Let’s not just be in an esport to be in an esport,\"</em> explains Kallas.</p></li></ol><p>As for the team itself, Kallas mentioned that there is no set timeline for TSM to enter CS:GO, but more updates would be made in the next three months, <em>\"There is a chance that TSM will have a lineup in time for the BLAST Major qualifiers, but it’s no guarantee.\"</em></p><p>For now, it is preparing to bring together a lineup in 2023 and setup the right infrastructure in place, while for 2024 it hopes to give competition to all the top teams.</p><p>TSM's return to CS:GO was much awaited and it is certainly a pleasant surprise. The community is eagerly waiting to see which players the organization ends up signing and how this project turns out to be following its arrival. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#F59422;border-left:10px solid #F59422\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/csgo/news/team-liquid-finally-completes-csgo-roster-after-four-months\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Team Liquid Finally Completes CS:GO Roster After Four Months</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-csgo\">",

However, he pointed out that ESL has largely ignored the duo, only hiring them for one tournament in 2016. <em>\"They have the lion share of the calendar and simply chose not to hire us for their events,\"</em> states Bardolph.</p><p>Soon after BLAST changed its format and cut down on the number of casters needed to run the show, using the same two pairs for each tournament.

The matchup between EDG and Paper Rex became the most viewed opening match across all VCT events till date with over 760,000 peak concurrent viewers tuning in, according to data from <ins><a href=\"https://escharts.com/tournaments/valorant/valorant-champions-2022\">Esports Charts</a></ins>.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>The Valorant community came together to contribute to the high viewership</h2><p>Valorant viewership dipped considerably in recent times with the previous Masters event getting some of the lowest viewership numbers we have seen for VCT events.

Tyson <strong>“TenZ”</strong> Ngo’s stream received over 1.4 Million views compared to the 200,000 to 300,000 total views he normally gets per stream.

If the team fails to win its next game, it will be eliminated from the world championship.</p><p>This is the last time we will have an open competition format for the Valorant Champions Tour and it marks the era of the format laid out by Riot Games three years ago. Starting next year, the game will move towards franchised leagues which means that there will be a lot more Valorant esports content for fans to consume and if you can’t get enough of pro matches, 2023 has some exciting stuff ahead.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text story-element-text-also-read\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px\"><p><span class=\"read_more_links\" style=\"color:#F59422;border-left:10px solid #F59422\">RELATED: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/valorant-champions-2022-group-stage-teams-schedule-scores-more\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Valorant Champions 2022 Group Stage: Teams, Schedule, Scores &amp; More</a></span></p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-csgo\">",

        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>The gaming market has been flooded by a number of new blockchain titles, thanks to the genre’s rise in popularity. Although these new projects are innovative, they haven’t been able to disrupt the legacy of well-known older projects such as the Sandbox, which is considered a pioneer in the Web3 gaming industry. Comprised of devoted developers and loyal fans, the Sandbox game has created an open metaverse where users can create their own experiences and interact with other people in-game.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>What is the Sandbox Alpha Season?</h2><p>While the Sandbox is one of the most popular blockchain gaming projects, it hasn’t been completely developed yet. The role of Alpha Season is to give players a sneak peek into the behind-the-scenes action. This means users can test out new features, take part in various social events, explore the Sandbox metaverse, try out the Play-to-Earn games and win exciting rewards. While this helps retain user interest for an ongoing project, it also helps developers iron out any bugs or glitches that exist in the game. Until now, there have been two Alpha Seasons of the Sandbox with each attracting flocks of users.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>The Sandbox Alpha Season 3</h2><p>With two successful seasons already over, the Sandbox recently <ins><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheSandboxGame/status/1559888157281222659\">announced</a></ins> the release date of Alpha Season 3. With exciting experiences, new features, and plenty of things to explore, fans all over the world are excited for the launch on the 24th August. </p><p>Here’s everything you need to know about this Alpha Season:</p><h3>Increase in Playable Experiences</h3><p>The Alpha Season three will have over 90 playable experiences and they will be revealed over the course of 10 weeks. There will be solo and multiplayer experiences that will keep users engaged. Notably, 27 of those experiences will include brand partners like Snoop Dogg, The Walking Dead, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), World of Women, and more. There will be 17 experiences from The Sandbox alongside 20 experiences supported by The Sandbox Game Maker Fund. This season will also feature 12 user-generated content and 16 experiences from Game Jams.</p><h3>Playable External Avatar</h3><p>The team at the Sandbox has successfully managed to voxelize avatars from 13 popular non-fungible token (NFT) collections hence making the Sandbox truly interoperable. These collections include Cool Cats, Clone X, World of Women, Moonbirds, Bored Ape Yacht Club, People of Crypto, Doggies, and more. These avatars will be playable within the Sandbox Alpha Season 3 and will serve as the user's digital identity.</p><h3>Rewards for Hodlers</h3><p>This season the Sandbox has introduced rewards for non-Alpha Pass holders. If a user holds a certain NFT during this season, they will be rewarded with SAND tokens. Apart from that, LAND owners, Avatar Holders and NFT collectors will also receive SAND rewards when completing a level. The rewards will be distributed as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Alpha Pass: up to 500 SAND</p></li><li><p>LAND Owner: up to 180 SAND</p></li><li><p>Avatar Owner: up to 60 SAND</p></li><li><p>NFT Collector: up to 30 SAND</p></li></ul><h3>Introduction of Leaderboard Rewards</h3><p>During Alpha Season 3, a total of 1.5M SAND tokens will be distributed to the top-ranking players on the leaderboard. Rankings will be calculated based on Ethos Points (EPs). Users will earn EPs for completing quests while taking into consideration the time to complete them. This means users who complete more quests in a short amount of time will be ranked higher on the leaderboard.</p><h3>AS3 Events</h3><p>Users can take part in many different events this season. Players can complete in-game and social media activities to complete challenges and participate in giveaways.</p><h3>Introduction of KYC System</h3><p>The Sandbox Alpha Season 3 will see the introduction of a Know Your Customer (KYC) system. This will help in preventing multi-accounting, and cheating, and through this system, the Sandbox hopes to increase fair play. Users can still participate in Alpha Season 3 without KYC but to join raffles and be eligible for Alpha Pass, KYC is mandatory.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p><em>This story was written in partnership with Linx Games</em></p><p>Linx Games is a community-driven blockchain game distribution platform for gamers and developers to interact, socialize and exchange ideas. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-cta\"><a class=\"story-cta-blockchaingames\" href=\"https://linx.games/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visit Linx Games</a></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\">",

        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Axie Origin has quickly gained popularity among fans of blockchain gaming. Initially, it was launched as a free-to-play substitute for the famous Axie Infinity title. But after witnessing the overwhelmingly positive response, Axie Origin has now started to function as an independent game. After the successful Alpha season, many fans worldwide have been patiently waiting for the launch of Season 0 of Axie Origin. On 12th August, Axie <ins><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AxieInfinity/status/1557879757853032449?s=20&amp;t=7B0KxGqMmB4i41JySDMF1w\">announced</a></ins> the transition of Origin into phase three, marking the launch of Season 0. As part of this transition, a plethora of important changes have been introduced to the game mechanics and the introduction of SLP rewards is one among them.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Updates and Changes in Axie Origin Season 0</h2><p>Users will be greeted by a sea of changes in the Axie Origin Season 0. These changes include updates to game mechanics and the introduction of new features. Some of these are based on the player feedback that was collected in the Alpha Season. Let’s dive into the details.</p><h3>Introduction of Smooth Love Potion ($SLP)</h3><p>The $SLP token will be moved from Axie Infinity Classic (V2) to Axie Origin. The introduction of the $SLP token in Axie Origin will help manage the tokenomics better due to the presence of different abilities in Origin. The $SLP token will be distributed as a reward in PvP battles, meaning that players need to climb up the leaderboard in order to receive better incentives. The $SLP obtained here will also be useful in crafting runes and charms.</p><h3>Increase in Leaderboard Rewards</h3><p>Season 0 also marks an increase in player rewards distribution. In the Alpha Season 49K $AXS tokens were distributed to 10K players, and now in Season 0, 60K $AXS tokens will be distributed to 20K players. This means more people will have the chance to earn monetary rewards in Axie Origin and will help with user engagement and retention.</p><h3>Changes in Crafting System</h3><p>Users can now craft runes and charms that can directly be minted onto the blockchain. These can be bought, sold, traded, or even gifted to other players. In Season 0, there will be new crafting recipes but crafting utility items such as moondust and moonstone will no longer be possible. However, these can be earned by progressing through the game. Apart from this, there is also a small change to utility item percentages.</p><h3>Disenchanting</h3><p>Disenchanting allows runes and charms to have sustained utility. Based on how players use their time and resources, they will gain value from this. This particular change hopes to strike the right balance between players who disenchant and players who do not.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-image\" style=\"position:relative\"><figure class=\"_4hRLP\" style=\"min-height:150px\"><img src=\"https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2022-08%2Fafd3cbf2-4ecb-4ae4-a9d7-fd987e8a657d%2FUntitled_design__14___1_.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;dpr=1.0&amp;format=webp&amp;w=768\" data-src=\"https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2022-08%2Fafd3cbf2-4ecb-4ae4-a9d7-fd987e8a657d%2FUntitled_design__14___1_.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;dpr=1.0\" sizes=\"( max-width: 500px ) 98vw, ( max-width: 768px ) 48vw, 23vw\" width=\"600\" height=\"318\" alt=\"Disenchanting Changes\" class=\"qt-image gm-loaded gm-observing gm-observing-cb\" loading=\"lazy\"><noscript><img src=\"https://gumlet.assettype.com/afkgaming%2F2022-08%2Fafd3cbf2-4ecb-4ae4-a9d7-fd987e8a657d%2FUntitled_design__14___1_.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;dpr=1.0&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Disenchanting Changes\"/></noscript><div class=\"story-element-caption-attribution-wrapper\"><figcaption class=\"story-element-image-attribution\"><div class=\"paragraphs\"><p><a href=\"https://axie.substack.com/p/phase3?utm_source=%2Fprofile%2F1286189-axie-infinity&amp;utm_medium=reader2\">Axie Substack</a></p></div></figcaption></div></figure></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h3>NFT Runes and Charms</h3><p>The beginning of Season 0 will mark the introduction of NFT Runes and Charms using ERC-1155 tokens. Dubbed as “Ronin” Runes and Charms, these objects will require $SLPs to craft. It can be minted on the blockchain and can be used traded or gifted using the marketplace. There is also a fixed minting fee of $3 USD in AXS per rune/charm.</p><h3>Moon Shard and Reward Changes</h3><p>Methods to earn Moon Shard and crafting items like Moon Dust and Ancient Moonstone will undergo changes in Season 0. Much like with $SLP rewards, the goal is to reward players who climb the leaderboard and progress through the ranks. There will be increased Moon Shards from ranked arena wins, and rewards from increasing crafting level. Utility crafting items will be distributed in the first-time rank-up rewards. There is also a decrease in Moon Shards from first time rank up. Players will earn fewer Moon Shards through Adventure, Star Milestone, and the Foraging box. Notably, another major change includes the removal of Moon Shards from account level up.</p><h3>Changes in Matchmaking and Victory Star</h3><p>In Season 0, there will be a change in the matchmaking. Apart from this, there will be a 10x for all Victory Stars for an easier transition to ELO. There will be a new challenger ELO system and along with this, Victory Star decay will be introduced.</p><h3>Season 0 Stickers</h3><p>Players will be handed out stickers for reaching the Chick rank and finishing in the top 20,000 on the Season 0 leaderboard.</p><h3>Balancing Changes</h3><p>Balancing changes impact the game mechanics and are considered to be an important part of any new in-game update. Season 0 balancing changes will see changes around Energy/Card scaling, AoE [Area of Effect], Card, and Rune changes.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>With these changes, Axie Origin is all set to venture into phase three of its roadmap.

        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>In recent years, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have found themselves in the limelight. From extravagant art collections to in-game utilities, NFTs have been used for a wide array of purposes. One of the earliest projects that kickstarted the whole hype around NFTs is Cryptopunks. These pixelated digital avatars have been closely associated with the digital Web3 community and their identity. But NFT projects today have evolved from simple jpegs to utility-based Decentralised Autonomous Organizations (DAO).</p><p>A new NFT project, Nouns, has found massive popularity in recent times with the current floor price being 99 ETH ($169,467 USD). One Noun is auctioned off each day with 100% of the proceeds going straight to the Nouns DAO treasury. As a functioning DAO, any user with a minimum of two nouns can submit a proposal and all members owning at least one noun can vote. Recently, the Nouns DAO passed Proposal #119 – Nouns Esports Pod, and since then, it has attracted a lot of attention.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>What is Proposal #119 – Noun Esports Pod?</h2><p>Out of all the DAOs that exist in the NFT community, the Nouns DAO has seen massive growth owing to bold decisions and community backing. Nouns Esports initiative was first announced via Proposal #68 where the member voted on signing a professional Dota 2 roster by the name of “4 zoomers”. The team played brilliantly maintaining a 74% win rate. The next advance into esports was led by Noun DAO Proposal #91 where members voted on signing a Pokemon Unite roster called “Random Gaming” and pursuing a partnership with BLVKHVND.</p><p>By now, it was evident, that as a community, Nouns had the will and resources to venture into competitive esports. Nouns Proposal #119, which was recently approved, focuses on the formation of an esports pod. Up until now, Nouns DAO had a very game-specific approach to esports but with this proposal, it plans to function similarly to a thriving small grant initiative within Nouns. This will enable quicker access to funds and plans are in place to sign a League of Legends team along with sending international players to the fighting game events.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Members of esports pod</h2><p>The esports pod consists of 11 members who are part of the Nouns community and have significant experience knowing the inner workings of the esports industry. These include:</p><ul><li><p>Sasquatch</p></li><li><p>Brennen</p></li><li><p>Maty</p></li><li><p>Oni</p></li><li><p>Brian Cho</p></li><li><p>Jason Oliver</p></li><li><p>Deeze</p></li><li><p>thebeautyandthepunk</p></li><li><p>Brax</p></li><li><p>PPD</p></li><li><p>Griff</p></li></ul><p>The structure of the esports pod is very flexible with options to add and remove members based on a supermajority vote. Members of the pod will be required to vote over the usage of funds with all members having an option to put forth a proposal. All fund usage will be monitored and documented in a completely transparent way for the Nouns Community to observe. A multi-signatory consisting of Sasquatch, Brennen, Maty, Brian Cho, and Oni will operate the funds.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Usage of Funds</h2><p>A budget of 369 ETH ($633,167 USD) is initially allocated for the usage of the esports pod. Potential uses of the funds include building the infrastructure for any current and future Nouns team. This includes bootcamp, logistics, equipment, and special events. Funds can also be used to sponsor additional players, teams, or streamers to boost awareness about Noun Esports. Apart from this, event sponsorship and funding projects might be undertaken. Funds could also be used to create merchandise for players and fans and to build items like Noggles with a blue light filter which relates to the Noun lore. Although these are the initial ideas, concrete decisions regarding their pursual will be made by the members of the esports pod.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Future Plans and Vision</h2><p>The Nouns esports pod will first and foremost be working towards being sustainable. This means that after the initial stage, if not cash positive, it should at least be breaking even. The inherent goal of the Esports Pod should be to proliferate the Nouns brand. Depending on how well the initiative is received, there could be a possibility of coverting the esports section into a sub-DAO. This would allow for greater engagement between players and fans. One of the most important works of the esports pod will be to enter into sponsor partnerships with traditional Web2 companies. Sponsorship deals can also be made with Web3 companies provided the DAO votes in the approval.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>With this, Nouns is growing out of the traditional NFT space and is actively becoming a well-rounded community project. The Nouns Esports Pod will ultimately work towards achieving more awareness about the NFT project while making sure that there are still real-life communities that users can be a part of. While Nouns might be one of the first NFT projects to venture into esports, fans and players will have to wait to see how it pans out.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p><em>This story was written in partnership with Linx Games</em></p><p>Linx Games is a community-driven blockchain game distribution platform for gamers and developers to interact, socialize and exchange ideas. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-cta\"><a class=\"story-cta-blockchaingames\" href=\"https://linx.games/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visit Linx Games</a></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\">",

Launched by Sky Mavis in March 2018, Axie Infinity has continued to top the charts and retain its dominance in the Web3 gaming market. However, unlike most other blockchain-based games, Axie Infinity has a significant entry barrier.</p><p>To combat this issue and to make the game more accessible Sky Mavis came up with the idea of Axie Origin. The introduction of Season 0 will mark the transition from phase two to phase three of the Axie Origin title. Apart from that, Season 0 will also bring many changes in the game mechanics. Users can expect to see new features, balance changes, and even the introduction of SLP rewards. Axie Origin was founded with the idea to make the transition into Web3 easier for new players. But since its launch on 7th April, Axie Origin has captivated user interest and is performing well as an individual title.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Alpha Season of Axie Origin</h2><p>The Alpha season was a part of the phase two plan of Axie Origin.

The daily active users of Axie Origin <ins><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AxieInfinity/status/1552820881298268160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1552820881298268160%7Ctwgr%5E1bf3f814608c5bf45d5beef6a3ed49377f79bfdc%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3D96f1f04c5f4143bcb0f2e68c87d65febschema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Faxieinfinity%2Fstatus%2F1552820881298268160image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fabs.twimg.com%2Ferrors%2Flogo46x38.png\">witnessed</a></ins> a growth of 263.636% and the downloads averaged around 3000 per day. Users who participated in the Alpha season would also receive $AXS rewards after the anti-cheat review of gameplay.</p><p>After the successful completion of the Alpha season, Axie Origin is currently moving into an off-season phase. Although players will be allowed to play the game and battle freely, there would be no additional rank-up rewards for them. Players should also remember to use the Moonshards, Moondust, and Ancient Moonstones as these would expire once Season 0 goes live. Rune and Charms are also not transferable but users can still disenchant them before Season 0 launches.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Season 0 of Axie Origin</h2><p>Due to the fact that the Alpha season just ended, interested users will have to wait a few more weeks before Axie Origin Season 0 goes live. The introduction of Season 0 will mark the transition from phase two to phase three of Axie Origin. Players can expect to see massive changes which would enable this game to be a full-fledged Web3 project. Season 0 will introduce NFT Runes and Charms that would require both SLP and Moonshards to craft.</p><p>Season 0 will also mark the introduction of SLP rewards in Origin after they are successfully removed from Classic (V2). The emission of Origin SLP would be tuned conservatively to better balance the in-game economy. Doing so could also make SLP a valuable secondary token. The SLP emission is projected to be much lower than Classic (V2) and players who climb ranked and move up on the leaderboard would be entitled to more SLP rewards.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Although blockchain-based gaming has progressed significantly in the last few years, no other game has managed to disrupt the legacy of Axie Infinity.

Reflect is looking to change this, putting a spotlight on building experiences that are built and developed for individuals themselves.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Your memories re-experienced in Reflect</h2><p>Reflect is a simulation game that will allow people to relive certain memories from throughout their life in the Metaverse. By purchasing the Reflect Mint Pass, players are able to have their memories created into an interactive world powered by Unity and Unreal Engine 5, featuring high-resolution AI Avatars that they can interact and play with.</p><p>Users can have their memories minted as an NFT on the blockchain that they can then interact with by playing in high-resolution gameplay. By spending 1 ETH ($1,717 USD), users can have their memories that date back to 2010. Each decade of a memory's age increases its price by 1 ETH, with Reflect offering users the option of minting \"any\" memory for 4 ETH. </p><p> Players would be required to upload any pieces of media that can help with the recreation of the memory along with a detailed description with a minimum 300 characters of the memory and a description of what happened in the media submitted. The team will then develop these memories that can then be re-experienced in the metaverse.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Other than your own memories, users who hold the Legendary Tier Mint pass have the option to collaborate with various institutions focused on historic preservation, such as museums to recreate historical experiences. You can experience memories such as the collapse of the Berlin wall or experience Martin Luther Kings “I have a dream speech”.</p><p>When you mint your NFT, simply stake it and your Metaverse will start development. The team will also have personal interviews with individuals to gloss over the details of your personalized virtual world and ensure that the experience is as accurate as it can be.</p><p>Memories can be minted and sold on open markets such as Opensea to allow others to experience your memories as well. Reflect plans to use an open world such as Sandbox or Decentraland but rather than utilizing plots like the other two, Reflect will use a co-existence of memories that can be joined and experienced by anyone.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>The Reflect experience</h2><p>Currently there is little information about the experience on the<a href=\"https://www.reflectgame.xyz/#hwdoesitwork\"> </a><ins><a href=\"https://www.reflectgame.xyz/#hwdoesitwork\">Reflect Website</a></ins>, but it did state that The Reflect Metaverse will be powered by the Epic games Unreal Engine 5 to provide state of the art graphics.</p><p>Reflect is also working on advanced NPCs that are AI Reflection Avatars that can behave and speak like the people present in your memory. You will have the option of having others join your memories as Smart NPCs (Non-Playable Characters). Throughout the memory, they will adapt and learn and to each memory making them a smart living NPC. This represents the end goal of a living, breathing metaverse built from the memories of an individual.</p><p>As per gameplay itself, the plan is to have branching experiences known as Quantum Jumping. Popular story based games such as Telltale games use this mechanic to provide branching experience and make different decisions that lead to different outcomes. With Reflect users can go through memories with a second chance to do things differently and make different choices to experience what might have happened or you can relive the memory in its entirety without changing any details.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>How to get started?</strong></h2><p>The game is currently exclusive to the <ins><a href=\"http://www.mirrorimageone.com/\">Mirror Image One console</a></ins>..

Sandbox is a huge metaverse where players and companies can create games and experiences for their users. These projects can range from simple art exhibitions to full-fledged Roblox-inspired games.</p><p>One of the projects on the Sandbox platform that has recently received massive recognition is Multiversity. Simply put, Multiversity is an education-themed, science-fantasy game that is currently under development on Sandbox. The rising popularity of Multiversity signifies that users are also interested in the productive, educational uses of the Metaverse and not just the gaming aspect of it.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>“Very Important Beings” NFT Project by Multiversity</h2><p>Much like other Web3 projects, Multiversity also plans to drop its NFT collection titled “<em>Very Important Beings</em>.” Inside the Multiversity metaverse, players can travel the world in search of ancient artifacts and socialize on the campus by meeting other students. The NFT collection is launching on 29th July at 3 pm UTC on the Sandbox Marketplace.</p><p>The NFT collection will feature characters from Multiversity that students will come across as they explore this metaverse. A few prominent characters in this collection are:</p><h3>Orchid</h3><p>Often regarded as the brains of Multiversity, Orchid is one of the three legendary Founders. She is also the head of Wisdom House and is considered to be extremely intelligent.</p><h3>Planetarium</h3><p>A planetarium is essentially a model of planets, asteroids, and other celestial bodies of the universe swirling around what appears to be a nova spring. Looking at it closely, users can even spot the Multiversity.</p><h3>Orenda</h3><p>Orenda is the dean and head of Arcane Science. She is an engine that keeps the Multiversity functional. She calms the chaos around campus, nurtures students, and fights against killer moths when they get in.</p><h3>Grimoire</h3><p>Grimoire is a book of extremely powerful spells. It contains many unknown secrets and is Orenda’s personal spellbook. Grimoire is unlike any other book in the Multiversity and is known to contain portals to different dimensions.</p><h3>Eve</h3><p>Eve is a leading expert and professor of ancient cosmic history in Multiversity. She considers time to be an infinite loop of past present and future and believes it to be insignificant.</p><h3>PAL</h3><p>PAL stands for Personal Assistant Liason.

But many crypto skeptics welcomed the ban.Despite this ban, one game named Fault: Elder Orb, an multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) continues to remain on Steam despite incorporating blockchain technology.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Fault: Elder Orb collaborates with Pocketful of Quarters</strong></h2><p>Developed and published by Strange Matter Studios, Fault: Elder Orb has collaborated with Pocketful of Quarters (PoQ), an organization that operates an \"interoperable game token\" called Quarters which operates on the Klaytn blockchain. These tokens can only be used to purchase in-game items in various games including titles other than Fault: Elder Orb.</p><p>Fault: Elder Orb’s adaptation of blockchain gaming is technically not a crypto currency, since players cannot sell the in-game tokens for real-world currency and can only transfer these tokens from title to title. So technically there are no play-to-earn elements present in the game despite this integration.</p><p>The game also ensures that this token system is completely optional. Even though this technicality allows the game to be on Steam there are still a few issues that border on Valve’s guidelines. For one, Quarters can be traded for rewards such as gift cards or game consoles, even though they cannot be cashed out for real money.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>As the token cannot be exchanged for real world money or sold to other players they don’t count as cryptocurrency but the games’ <ins><a href=\"https://github.com/weiks/poq-docs\">Github</a></ins> page for Quarters and even the<a href=\"https://invest.poq.gg/POQ_Whitepaper_v4.0.pdf\"> </a><ins><a href=\"https://invest.poq.gg/POQ_Whitepaper_v4.0.pdf\">whitepaper</a></ins> refer to the tokens as a cryptocurrency.</p><p>Considering that Steam specifically states that blockchain games that “ issue or allow exchange of cryptocurrencies or NFTs” are the only ones that are banned from the platform, Fault: Elder Orb may stick around in the store in the long run. Valve is yet to address the matter.</p><p>Fault: Elder Orb is allowing you to choose your play style through the various characters. An adrenaline fuelled 5v5 arena match similar to Smite with an over the shoulder perspective. The focus is on maintaining the tactical strategy aspect of the classics with new innovations.</p><p>Players have to work in a team to fight off the minions and their opponents in each match while collecting gold to upgrade their gear.

        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>On 20th July, Minecraft developer Mojang announced a ban on the integration of NFTs within the game. This ban comes as a means to ensure that the player base has access to the same functions and rules and that there are no discrepancies.</p><p>Mojang rejected the blockchain space entirely, adding that NFTs will not be allowed to be integrated with in-game content and also issued a ban on both the client and server-side applications. The<ins><a href=\"https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-and-nfts\"> blog post</a></ins> stated, \"<em>We have these rules to ensure that Minecraft remains a community where everyone has access to the same content.</em>” It added that NFTs can create models of scarcity and exclusion that conflict with the guidelines and the spirit of Minecraft.</p><p>This news affected various projects, existing and upcoming ones, but NFT Worlds was rough hit. The project was one of the forerunners in the NFT Minecraft space and following Mojang’s statement, it saw a massive plummet in the value of its tokens and NFTs.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>The rise and fall of NFT Worlds</strong></h2><p>NFT Worlds is an NFT collection with 10,000 unique Minecraft worlds. Each NFT contains a world seed which is a code generated by each Minecraft world. Once a user purchases an NFT, they can use their seed from their token contract and use it in Minecraft.</p><p>According to the official website, “<em>NFT Worlds is a fully decentralized, fully customizable, community-driven, play-to-earn gaming platform where world owners can create their own limitless metaverse games or experiences for players or exclusive communities within their worlds.</em>\"</p><p>Players can also host their world as a destination within the Metaverse and the project would have builders to help NFT holders build their Metaverse experience. NFT World uses Web3 to make Minecraft worlds into tokens that can be sold through their own cryptocurrency known as $WRLD.</p><p>The project on<a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/nft-worlds\"> </a><ins><a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/nft-worlds\">OpenSea</a></ins> had garnered over 30,000 ETH in trade volume, resulting in $90 Million USD. The project had generated over $75 Million USD in transactions with the base NFT going from 3 ETH ($4619) to the base price now being at 1.333 ETH ($2052). The Token had hit a peak of$0.593152 on 20th February but after the ban, the coin, according to <ins><a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nft-worlds/\">Coinmarketcap</a></ins>, is currently valued at $0.01374.</p><p>In a<a href=\"https://routing.nftworlds.com/ipfs/QmXRLKdmEReiTWoESHFfUUrJoWkUX2obye3urL6x8zt5Bx\"> </a><ins><a href=\"https://routing.nftworlds.com/ipfs/QmXRLKdmEReiTWoESHFfUUrJoWkUX2obye3urL6x8zt5Bx\">statement</a>,</ins> NFT Worlds said the ban came “<em>without warning.</em>” It added, “<em>Microsoft, Mojang and Minecraft have signaled they have no regard for creators, builders and players if at any moment a new idea or vision conflicts with any internal politics or opinions of their power holding minority; regardless of their public-facing ideals around creators and developers they say they uphold.</em>”</p></div></div><div class=\"lazyload-wrapper \"><div style=\"height:200px\" class=\"lazyload-placeholder\"></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>The Future of NFT Worlds</strong></h2><p>This is not the end of the road for NFT Worlds. It quickly announced that it would be taking on Minecraft in a “Web2 vs Web3” battle and developing its own game to replace what it lost in Minecraft.</p><p>“<em>We’re creating a new game and platform based on many of the core mechanics of Minecraft, but with the modernization and active development [that] Minecraft has been missing for years. This is not a rewrite of some open-source Minecraft clone, which likely would violate the EULA or still risk legal action, this is entirely from the ground up. This transition will additionally come with a public-facing brand identity change that is more player friendly.</em>”</p><p>The game is looking to update the graphics and optimize the performance with new mechanics while maintaining the same “<em>playstyle, look and feel</em>” of Minecraft. It will be free for players and NFT Worlds will ensure backward compatibility with existing server plugins for Minecraft to ensure a smooth transition from Minecraft to its new game.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>The NFT Debate</strong></h2><p>Following its announcement, Mojang came under a lot of scrutiny. Numerous people pointed out how the blog post ironically spoke about digital scarcity that promotes exclusivity and contended that digital scarcity has always existed in Minecraft. For example, the in-game skins, as the creations and accounts are all owned by Microsoft.</p><p>It is noteworthy that Microsoft only provides a limited license, whereas NFTs promote ownership. Another point Mojang made was that it was protecting the younger audiences, but Minecraft promotes its virtual currency called MineCoins which can be used within the in-game marketplace.</p><p>Another move of Mojang’s that came under fire was its new moderation system that banned players and private servers. These servers are owned, maintained, and handled by players who paid for them but Mojang made it clear that players do not own the servers.</p><p>When a Twitter user asked Epic Games to take a similar stance on the matter of NFTs, Epic’s CEO <ins><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1549945146413907970?s=20&amp;t=5K0RRe-EpQi2Uh74QjutxQ\">Tim Sweeney</a></ins> replied, “<em>Developers should be free to decide how to build their games, and you are free to decide whether to play them. I believe stores and operating system makers shouldn’t interfere by forcing their views onto others. We definitely won’t.</em>”</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>NFTs in gaming have become a hot topic of debate. Many companies have come forward to adopt them in their games but have been facing criticism from various stakeholders. For instance, Ubisoft's internal team criticized the company’s foray into the NFT space. Given this strained situation, a company as large as Mojang banning NFTs can be seen as harmful. This could potentially leave players and investors second-guessing before entering the space.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p><em>This story was written in partnership with Linx Games</em></p><p>Linx Games is a community-driven blockchain game distribution platform for gamers and developers to interact, socialize and exchange ideas. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-cta\"><a class=\"story-cta-blockchaingames\" href=\"https://linx.games/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visit Linx Games</a></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\">",

The courses will be directed towards a wide audience ranging from junior high school students to those already in the workforce who are looking to expand or grasp the fundamentals of the Metaverse. The courses are designed to take place within a Metaverse.</p><p><ins><a href=\"https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14677709\">The Asahi Shimbun</a></ins> reported that the courses and study programs will not be a regular faculty that offers degrees. Instead, it will be set up by Todai’s Faculty of Engineering and engineering-related graduate schools. Upon completing the course, students will receive certificates.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>The project’s key aim is to tackle the issue of having skilled people within the Metaverse space and to ensure that they are updated with the advancements of technology.</p><p>It should be noted that the topics of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies were not specifically mentioned in the course curriculum. But due to their association with the Metaverse and given that a number of popular Metaverse brands utilize both Crypto and NFTs, it is safe to assume that the courses will have some mention of blockchain technologies. It could also include the working of blockchain technologies and how they are utilized on various platforms.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Who is eligible for the Metaverse courses?</strong></h2><p>The younger audience including junior-high and high school students will be taught an introductory course on the Metaverse and will also be introduced to engineering. This is an attempt to help the students choose a viable career path and gauge their options in the engineering and Metaverse industries.</p><p>Online and face-to-face classes will be held for the students and guardians to help them understand the engineering course structures. Students will also experience hands-on learning and training where companies partnered with Todai will conduct practical classes.</p><p>Students at other universities will also have access to the Todai Metaverse. This will enable them to learn about the various engineering programs present within The University of Tokyo.</p><p>The course is not just for school students. The course is also looking to attract those in university or those who are already a part of the workforce and looking to upgrade their knowledge or get reacquainted with the subject matter themselves via online courses that put a focus on entrepreneurial education, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and more.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14677709\">The Asahi Shimbun</a>, these courses will also act as a platform to tackle the lack of female representation in the engineering university programs and will push to attract more female students.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Utilizing the Metaverse</strong></h2><p>The metaverse will play a key part in these courses and will be tackling the issue of inclusiveness.

They execute the decisions made and agreed by everyone participating in the DAO. This allows the community to be vocal when it comes to making decisions like treasury allocations or technical upgrades.</p><p>Star Atlas is now tapping into the power of the community for future decisions about the game through the Star Atlas Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This will allow players and stakeholders to vote on governance issues within the game.</p><p>This is just the start as future plans for the platform will include players, who are a part of the Metaverse, to participate on every level of governance. The lite paper even suggested that the game’s long-term vision is a fully player-owned game. It will be controlled and funded through its decentralized nature and eventually become autonomous.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>This is just another step in allowing the players to determine what kind of game they want and steer the project as they please. Notably, Star Atlas plans to have a DAO for each faction. The DAO will determine different aspects of the game such as controlled regions or even distribution of taxes.</p><p>The DAO’s purpose will be to control in-game assets through various on-chain tools to manage activities, in-game items, manage the treasuries, and coordinate other activities.</p><p>“<em>I am thrilled to announce the launch of the platform that will in the future give users the ability to participate in Star Atlas governance via the DAO,</em>” said Michael Wagner, the CEO of Automata (ATMTA) who is one of the lead developers of Star Atlas.</p><p>He continued, “<em>Holders of POLIS will be able to lock their tokens from two weeks up to five years, which entitles them to voting power on public proposals.

This new marketplace is a revamp of what previously existed on the Star Atlas website. The marketplace has a better user experience and it can sell and buy assets directly to and from other players.</p><p>The Galactic Marketplace is an economic hub built on the Solana Blockchain and enables the users around the world to trade in-game assets such as spaceships. Notably, it is bringing near-zero operating costs.</p><p>Luciano Castello, product lead for the marketplace, in a statement said, “<em>One of our primary objectives was to make sure this new version of the marketplace solved real problems that you, the community, helped us identify by participating in user research and being vocal on Discord.

However, we see a lot of projects that are similar to the already existing Web3 games. At the moment, there is a lack of creativity in blockchain-based games and this, in turn, leads to user interest diminishing. But Synergy Land hopes to bring in change and fix these glaring issues.</p><p>Synergy Land is a blockchain-based Action Role Playing Game (ARPG) that is divided into four ecosystems: Fire, water, earth, and ice. Users can explore the open world and choose to play different heroes. They can discover dungeons and take on powerful bosses in teams of four using a team-based spell system. Inspired by Diablo and Path of Exile, Synergy Land hopes to create an ecosystem that bodes well for experienced and new players alike. Players will be able to trade in-game assets and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and also play cross-platform in this blockchain-based, open-world game.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>What can you do in Synergy Land?</h2><p>Synergy Land is an immersive 3D world game with a large exploration area, where players can fight dangerous bosses and craft items to progress in the game. However, the core gameplay of Synergy Land involves two main aspects – Heroes and Pets.</p><p>Heroes are characters that players can choose to play as. Users must master the skills of the selected heroes to maximize their chance of victory when battling bosses. Upon selecting a hero, users can compete in arena battles and win rewards by ranking higher on the leaderboard each season. Apart from the arena, users can also team up with friends to play in the multiplayer mode. Playing as a team increases the chances of defeating enemies and reaping rewards from the dungeons.</p><p>Along with Heroes, users can also choose their pets at the beginning of the game. With pets, players are presented with the opportunity to compete in turn-based RPG battles. There are unique sets of abilities for each pet and mastering them will give the player the chance to combine abilities and create powerful synergies. Users can also earn NFT prices by ranking among the best players on the leaderboard.</p><p>Two compatible pets can be brought together to produce an offspring. Once pets are bred, they will lay an egg which will need hatching. The new pet inherits the properties of its parents. However, using the items obtained from dungeons, these properties can be manipulated.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>How to play Synergy Land</h2><p>Synergy Land is not out yet.

As the users explore the open world and rank up on the leaderboard, they will receive NFT rewards. These can be bought and sold via the NFT marketplace. Trading in the NFT marketplace is done using the $SNG token.</p><h3>FT Marketplace</h3><p>In this marketplace, players will be able to trade FT items using $ACN token.

        "author": " Shivang Patel",
        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Over the last few years, the blockchain gaming industry has seen some steady growth. A lot of the current and upcoming games are based on the prevalent model of Play-to-Earn (P2E). Although this model is highly popular, it is not perfect. There are several issues with the P2E model that have been ignored by a lot of companies.</p><p>Bounty Temple, a Polygon (MATIC)-based blockchain game, has come up with a method to address and rectify the current problems with the P2E system. Bounty Temple is a spin-to-win blockchain game that incorporates the use of an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) called Bounty Temple Monument (BTM). Using this NFT, players can play with or against each other. Users are also rewarded with tokens and can stake them to earn more profit. Unlike other games, Bounty Temple is based on a Play-to-Earn Evolution (P2EE) model. This is vastly different from the existing model and hopes to fix the issues with the current system.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Problems with the current Play-to-Earn Model</h2><p>The present state of P2E games is great at attracting new users by showing them the economic incentives they would receive but it has become increasingly difficult to retain players due to the lackluster gameplay and unoptimized revenue model. Apart from this, there are several major issues. They are as follows:</p><h3>Frequent token price fluctuations</h3><p>The current price of in-game tokens is directly related to the minting frequency by developers and larger market trends. There is no mechanism to control the price volatility and therefore, the user funds quickly depreciate in value.</p><h3>Lack of security in NFT rentals</h3><p>A lot of popular games have recently started an NFT rental system. However, these rental systems operate in a trust-based manner. Therefore, the interests of both parties are not completely secured and remain a matter of concern.</p><h3>Absence of a token burning mechanism</h3><p>In almost all blockchain-based games, the minting rate of native tokens is higher than the purchasing rate. In such scenarios, it becomes important to have an effective token-burning mechanism. The absence of such a mechanism leads to the token value depreciating and as a result user interest dwindles.</p><h3>Uncontrolled Supply of NFTs</h3><p>With the advent of blockchain gaming, NFTs have been used as value markers. Higher rarity NFTs fetch higher prices and increase the competition. However, when there is an uncontrolled supply of NFTs, the value of the NFT decreases. The asset class is devalued and the competition ceases to exist. This also leads to a lack of user interest.</p><h3>Changing stats of NFT for balancing</h3><p>Along with uncontrolled supply, nerfing the NFT causes the asset to be devalued. It loses its importance in the market and often experiences price reduction.</p><h3>Unfair reward distribution</h3><p>Users who join the game later have often received substantially fewer rewards in comparison to the older players. This leads to an unfair reward system and harms the experience of users.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>The P2EE system of Bounty Temple</h2><p>As discussed, the current state of blockchain-based games is suffering due to a lack of foresight and planning on certain important issues. With its new P2EE system, Bounty Temple is on its way to create a sustainable blockchain game that is capable of handling prevalent problems using certain mechanisms. It presents the following possibilities:</p><h3>Stable Token</h3><p>To counter price fluctuations, Bounty Temple will use a proprietary algorithm called “<em>Weather Effect.</em>” This will control the mining rate of its native token $GIA and will aim to achieve market equilibrium.This will aslo help keep token price in check.</p><h3>Centralized Scholar System</h3><p>This system will handle all the NFT rental details and will work to make it more secure and efficient by using features like auto payout, KYC verification, and a scoring system.</p><h3>Robust token burning</h3><p>Several token-burning activities like crafting, upgrading, charity events, mini-games, and lottery tickets will be introduced to ensure token burning.</p><h3>NFT burning and holding incentive</h3><p>This feature ensures that there is not an oversupply of NFTs in the marketplace by giving users incentives for burning their NFT. Users will also be rewarded with incentives for holding NFTs.</p><h3>Balanced Gameplay Mechanic</h3><p>The Bounty System is designed in such a way that there is no need to nerf NFTs to balance the game. This protects the value of a users NFT and depending upon the burning mechanism, the value will appreciate over time.</p><h3>Barrier Effect</h3><p>To ensure that newly crafted NFTs do not experience massive price drops from the Weather Effect, Bounty Temple has created a \"<em>Barrier Effect</em>\". This ensures that the rate of earning of new NFTs will not be targeted by the Weather Effect for 75 days.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Interested users can also read the complete <ins><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mvIJUCQJF2HGcKvDf1zfh1CiO3aOrIhh/view\">Litepaper </a></ins>from the official <ins><a href=\"https://bountytemple.com/index.html\">website</a></ins>. Overall, Bounty Temple has added several mechanisms to ensure that the game can retain user interest over long periods of time, and that the Play-to-Earn Evolution model can function in a way that keeps users at the forefront of the system. This shows us that Bounty Temple is committed to drawing attention to issues with the Play-to-Earn model and keeps providing users with better alternatives.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p><em>This story was written in partnership with Linx Games</em></p><p>Linx Games is a community-driven blockchain game distribution platform for gamers and developers to interact, socialize and exchange ideas. </p></div></div><div class=\"story-cta\"><a class=\"story-cta-blockchaingames\" href=\"https://linx.games/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visit Linx Games</a></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\">",

The two new games namely Mech Angel and Alien Mews have been in development for quite some time and owing to the vast experience of the developers, the company has also managed to secure external funding.</p><p>TenthPlanet was initially founded by William Wei Chan, former game development leader of TikTok gaming. William Wei Chan was also the founder of a popular tech company called Mokun Technology, which was sold to TikTok in 2019 in a deal valued in an excess of $200 Million USD. The company later launched TikTok games, like One Piece, which were an instant hit for the target audience.</p><p>Mech Angel is an MMOARPG (massively multiplayer online action roleplaying game) that draws inspiration from already popular titles such as Genshin Impact. The storyline points to a world where there is no peace and humans are forced to battle armed mecha robots to restore harmony. Users will be able to play as different characters and team strategy will be at the center of this game. On the other hand, Alien Mews is a cat metaverse where users can raise and interact with digital pets.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>What is TenthPlanet's Mech Angel?</h2><p>Mech Angel is an anime-styled MMOARPG game. So far, TenthPlanet has invested a significant amount of money at around $6.5 Million USD and plans to raise more money in the funding rounds. Mech Angel will feature Player versus Environment (PvE) and Player vs Player (PvP) game modes. Users will be able to complete environment-based challenges or compete against other players. The animated art style is used vividly throughout the game as user interest in Japanese-style animation has increased globally and has become mainstream.</p><p>Mech Angel plans to launch on iOS, Android, and PC. So far, the beta testing for mobile devices is already completed. Along with this, the company hopes to launch a demo for PC in the fourth quarter and beta testing in Q1 2023. Additionally, the development of in-game wallets and the marketplace is also underway as the game hopes to have a complete ecosystem ready before launch.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>What is Alien Mews?</h2><p>Alien Mews is a cat life metaverse where users can breed and nurture a digital cat. This game draws inspiration from Crypto Kitties as users here can generate value from breeding their cats. Currently, Tenth Planet has already invested around $2.5 Million USD in this game. These funds will be used to develop an extensive metaverse where users can collect, breed, train, and upgrade their cats. Apart from this, the players will also be able to compete in mini-games with their cats.</p><p>Alien Mews is expected to have a video demo available in Q3 2022 along with a playable demo in Q4 2022. The company plans to launch a beta version of Alien Mews in Q1 2023 with ample mini-games for users to play with their cats.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Views on the development and future of the blockchain gaming space</h2><p>The blockchain gaming space has seen massive growth in the last couple of years as users transition from pay-to-win to the play-to-earn model of games.

As players continue to win, they climb positions on the leaderboard and depending upon your position, you can earn rewards. Apart from this, users can trade the cards with other players using the native token $MOL.</p><p>Another interesting mode of Mollector is the World Boss. Players join forces and try to defeat the extremely powerful World Boss. To defeat this boss, players might need to combine and mutate their cards to increase the strength of their deck.</p><p>Gameplay is simple for Molector. Players use their hero cards to attack the opponent, with the goal of destroying all of the opponent's cards. The game ends when one of the teams loses all of its cards after being destroyed by the opponent.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>How to download and play Mollector?</h2><p>Mollector is not out yet.

To receive the console, players need to have pre-ordered the console and own the ‘Polium pass,’ an NFT, with 10,000 mints which is on the Ethererum network. The company wrote, “<em>The Polium Pass will be a collection of 10,000 NFTs that will be on the Ethereum blockchain. By purchasing this pass, you will be pre-ordering the Polium One console and will receive benefits.</em>”</p><p>Polium is looking to combat the complexity of building or buying a gaming PC and looking for a cost-effective alternative.

Currently, the MPL mobile app on iOS and Android offers over 70 games in different categories such as board games, fantasy gaming, and many others. However, it plans to enter the Web3 and Blockchain gaming space by establishing GGX– a non fungible token (NFT) marketplace that will allow players to purchase and trade of in-game assets.</p><p><ins><a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/mpl-forays-into-web3-gaming-in-talks-to-raise-10-15-million/articleshow/92553474.cms\">According to The Economic Times</a></ins>, MPL is in “advanced talks” with investment firm Spartan Capital and Polygon to raise the necessary capital through a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFTs).

This new initiative will be named GGX and it is expected to primarily function as a marketplace for trading in-game assets similar to an exchange platform. MPL plans to have multiple users and game developers on this platform, according to The Economic Times’ sources.</p><p>This will enable players who acquire assets on any game on the GGX platform to freely trade with other users on the platform, even if they’re not the same game titles. This is possible because the platform is expected to allow any game developer to monetize games using the GGX software toolkit.</p><p>Considering that MPL had just created its Mayhem game studio in May, the expansion into Blockchain Gaming seems like a natural step for the platform. The studio gives the organization access to the required resources and skill sets to build and launch the GGX platform.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <p>The popularity of Axie Infinity has opened the eyes of many investors to the potential of the play-to-earn sector.

All user funds are fully backed on a 1:1 basis by the new bridge and users have been made whole, developers said in the announcement.</p><p>The Axie Infinity Ronin Bridge hack is one of the most high-profile exploits in Blockchain Gaming and took place on 29 March. 173.6 Thousand ETH and 25.5 Million USDC were drained from the network after hackers managed to gain unauthorized access to private validator keys.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Axie Infinity tightens its security</strong></h2><p>Axie Infinity announced that they have conducted three audits(one internal, two external) in a measure to bolster their security. The report that Sky Mavis released after the hack, highlighted the lack of decentralization as one of the key problems. Hence these new changes focus on decentralizing the power to thwart any future hacks.</p><p>The company has revealed a contingency plan called <em>“Ronin Circuit Breaker System”</em> that is designed to flag <em>“large, suspicious withdrawals,”</em> introduces a withdrawal limit, and adds <em>“human reviewers”</em> to verify transactions on the Ronin Bridge.</p><p>These withdrawal limits would function in a tier-based system with tier one being for withdrawals for less than $1 Million USD and requiring 70% of the validator signatures, tier two for withdrawals exceeding $1 Million and requiring 90% of validator signatures, and tier three with withdrawals exceeding $10 Million. All withdrawals of tier 3 would require 90% validator signatures and human review. A small transaction charge will also be levied and it will be subject to a seven-day review process.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>User Funds to be reinstated as promised</h2><p>Sky Mavis announced that user funds that were stolen in a $600 Million hack will be reimbursed as promised. A total of 117,600 ETH and 25.5 Million USDC will be recompensed 1:1 by providing ETH liquidity to the user’s wETH (wrapped Ether) on the Ronin Network.</p><p>They also added that the remaining 56,000 wETH that belonged to the Axie DAO treasury, will remain undercollateralized. In the meantime, Sky Mavis will be working closely with law enforcement to recover the funds. If the funds are not recovered within two years, then the Axie DAO would vote and decide the next step.</p><p>In April, <ins><a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/axie-infinity-developer-sky-mavis-raises-150m-following-security-hack-that-stole-600m\">Sky Mavis raised $150 Million in funding with Binance leading this round of investments</a></ins>. The company had stated that this would be used to reimburse user funds affected by the attack on the Ronin Network.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Future Plans for Axie Infinity:</h2><p>Sky Mavis also talked about their plans for Axie Infinity and updates that are about to go live soon. One of the key features that the entire community is looking forward to is the land staking. On the other hand, Axie Infinity Origin is also making huge progress after registering 600,000 accounts.</p><p>The phase plans for Axie Infinity Origin starts with balance changes in phase one and focus on the progression reset of Moonshards, MMR, and Rune in phase two. Phase three will see the introduction of SLP rewards and NFT Runes/Charms. The final phase, phase four will prepare for global launch season 1.</p><p>Earlier this month, Bloomberg <ins><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-10/axie-infinity-axs-crypto-game-promised-nft-riches-gave-ruin?utm_medium=social&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic#xj4y7vzkg\">reported</a></ins> that Axie Infinity had lost 40% of its user base since the hack. At the time of writing, the value of AXS is at $15.30 (a drop for its $160.36 peak in July 2021) while the value of SLP is at 0.0039 (down from its peak of 0.364 in July 2021). It will be interesting to see if the game can regain some of its lost users following this move.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\">",

        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>Ever since <a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/guide/how-to-download-axie-infinity-for-android-and-ios\">Axie Infinity</a> burst onto the scene, the term ‘GameFi’ has been steadily gaining steam with many enthusiasts beginning to explore the title. Unlike traditional games where people play for fun or to improve their skills, GameFi games incentivize people by offering them a chance to make money while having fun gaming. So, what is GameFi? How is it different from the games we already play? Here is everything you need to know to get introduced to the world of GameFi, and its importance to blockchain gaming.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>What is GameFi?</strong></h2><p>GameFi is a combination of the words \"Game\" and \"Finance.\" It is typically used to refer to blockchain games that players can play to earn money. Usually, players can earn real-world cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by completing tasks, fighting other players, and moving up through the game levels. In games using GameFi technology, the rewards are usually cryptocurrencies or in-game assets like virtual land, avatars, weapons, and costumes. Most of the time, the in-game assets will help players in some way, letting them earn even more rewards.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div> <h2>A Brief History of GameFi</h2><p>The idea for GameFi originated from a blockchain game called CryptoKitties, which was built on the Ethereum network, at a time when the concept of NFTs was incredibly niche. Then the NFT economy took off, and at its peak, CryptoKitties had more than 14K users playing the game every day. Unfortunately, the popularity of these NFTs slowed down the Ethereum network, which caused transaction fees to skyrocket and confirmation times to slow down.</p><p>It was at that time that developers realized the need for improved blockchains that promise faster transaction speeds, more scalability, and lower fees. These platforms include BSC, Solana, Polkadot, Polygon, Wax, and Cardano, among others.</p><p>The expansion of Decentralised Finance (DeFi) platforms boosted the popularity of GameFi. Because new blockchain-native financial systems that operate only on smart contracts developed. This gave users the tools they needed to launch, trade, lend, or bet their in-game tokens.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>How Do GameFi Projects Work?</h2><p>Almost all GameFi projects have in-game items that are NFTs– which act as \"virtual deeds\" that show who owns that piece of digital art or media file (using blockchain technology), tied to your crypto wallets, meaning that you will have proof of ownership of these items.</p><p>Players can earn these items by spending time in the game, completing tasks, achieving in-game objectives, leveling up, or other means. These items can then be taken out of the game and then can be traded or sold on various NFT marketplaces.</p><p>This is the fundamental basis of how these games turn into play to earn, bringing in money for full-time players. Unfortunately, many of the play-to-earn games out there right now rely upon \"grinding\" to make these NFTs rare and inflate the price of these items.</p><p>However, a few upcoming GameFi titles like Zed Run and The Sandbox use mechanics like betting and renting to pay out NFTs to their players.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>How Do I Start Playing Games on GameFi?</strong></h2><p><strong>1. Make a crypto wallet</strong></p><p>First off, you need to make a cryptocurrency wallet that works with GameFi and is compatible with the game you are playing. For instance, you need to use the Ronin Wallet for Axie Infinity while you can useMetaMask, Bitski, or Venly for The Sandbox.</p><p><strong>2. Make your initial investment or get a scholarship</strong></p><p>Typically, you'll most likely need to make an initial investment to play GameFi games. You usually set up a team of characters (Axie Infinity), and purchase in-game land (The Sandbox), cards (Splinterlands), or other in-game items to place yourself in a position to earn money.</p><p>Obviously, this puts you at risk of losing your investment. So do your due diligence about the game, the security of its wallet, and its potential and only then invest your money if you are absolutely sure of getting into the digital crypto-economy. It comes with its own due risk.</p><p>If you are unsure about investing your money, there are programs in titles like Axie Infinity called “scholarships,” where players can basically borrow NFTs from another player and use them to play the game, in exchange for sharing a percentage of your income with the lender.</p><p><strong>3. Start playing and earning</strong></p><p>Then all that's left for you to do is to start playing and start earning.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>What Are Some of the GameFi Games? How Are They Doing?</h2><p>As the field of cryptoverse is booming various GameFI games are coming into the spotlight. Some of the best-known examples of GameFi projects are:</p><p><strong>Axie Infinity</strong></p><p>Developed by the Vietnamese company <a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/news/axie-infinity-developer-sky-mavis-raises-150m-following-security-hack-that-stole-600m\">Sky Mavis</a>, Axie Infinity is an online video game that employs the Ethereum-based currencies AXS and SLP. \"Axies\" (axolotl-based characters digitized as NFT) can be collected and bred in this game, as well as fought and traded. Usually, the rarer and stronger an Axie, the more players are willing to pay to obtain it.</p><p>At the initial stages of Axie Infinity, the player base could earn more from playing the game than their daily jobs. But as the number of the player base is rising and the increment of circulation of SLP in the market rather than using in-game decreased the profit players can make from the game, causing a huge drop down in player base in recent times.</p><p><strong>Decentraland</strong></p><p>Decentraland is a virtual world where every region and object on the virtual globe is an NFT. Players rent, buy and sell these NFTs depending on various factors.</p><p><ins><a href=\"https://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2021/12/decentraland-blockchain-metaverse-user-revenue-stats.html\">According to Wagner James Au</a></ins>, Decentraland co-founder Ari Meilich claimed that the game has 300K monthly active users, 18K daily active users, and a peak concurrent player base of 2.5K.</p><p><br><strong>CryptoBlades</strong></p><p>CryptoBlades is a play-to-earn NFT RPG game that can be played on the BSC, Heco, Polygon, OEC and Avalance networks. Riveted Games is the maker of CryptoBlades. When a player first starts playing CryptoBlades, they begin in a plaza where they have to customize their first character. The character’s elements are assigned randomly. The player can use a small amount of BNB gas to fight an enemy. The game then keeps rolling to decide the outcome of the fight and adds the result to the blockchain. When a player wins a round they get two types of rewards: SKILL and character experience.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>What Are the Challenges That GameFi Games Are Facing?</h2><p>A large number of games are currently available on the market that is based on the P2E(Play to Earn gaming) concept. Most P2E games are made to get players interested in making money, but gaming products should be more about how people feel when they play. So, players lose interest in the game and start looking for other ways to spend their money where the assets are worth more. This makes sense from their point of view because there's no reason to keep playing if the value of your asset keeps going down every hour.</p><p>Take, for instance, Axie Infinity, a well-known game. A gamer needs three characters to get started, and each character used to cost an average of $220. Thus, the cost of a single entry ticket is around $660. There's a good chance that most gamers won't be willing to shell out that much money for the game. However, this is changed now. On the Marketplace, some Axies are for sale for 0.008 ETH, which is just over $20. This means that if you only bought these NFTs, you could put together a starting team for less than $100. That is still quite some investment as the pricing of SLP is dropping drastically.</p><p>GameFi's data suggest that the majority of players are from nations with developing economies. Working-class people cannot have access to such a high barrier.</p><p>Renting video game avatars and another NFTs is becoming increasingly popular, as a result. This issue hampers growth and the influx of new players.</p><p>Some common problems that the GameFi games are facing are:</p><ul><li><p>Huge waiting time</p></li><li><p>Slow-paced games</p></li><li><p>Huge transaction fees</p></li><li><p>Inability to integrate GameFi into existing gaming communities.</p></li><li><p>Complex blockchain user interface</p></li></ul></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>A Look at What Lies Ahead for GameFi</strong></h2><p>As blockchain technology keeps getting better, GameFi is likely to keep growing at a fast rate. GameFi is very popular, especially in developing countries, because you can own things in games and make money from them.</p><p>It's easy to see how GameFi draws in gamers by offering both fun and money-making opportunities. As blockchain games become more popular, it's likely that more and more big companies will start building up the metaverse.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\"><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\">",

        "content": "<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>The value of Axie Infinity's utility currency Smooth Love Potion (SLP) has dropped by 99.9% from its peak value of $0.42 in July 2021 to $0.0034. SLP has had a slow decline over the past few months, but it has accelerated by a significant margin in the last 7 days were its value plummeted by 31.70%. </p><p>The governance token initially gained popularity by rewarding real-world players for playing the game and and could be spent to breed new Axies. But over the last few months, the number of rewards given out to players dropped significantly, limiting the amount of money players could earn, forcing many to stop playing. </p><p>With many players selling all their SLP on crypto markets instead of spending it in the game, there is a huge oversupply of SLPs leading to inflationary concerns.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2>Axie Infinity's <strong>SLPs are now worth lower than a cent</strong></h2><p>SLP started trading on UniSwap around the $0.03 mark at the beginning of January 2020. The token was one of the first of its kind, and the idea that you could earn things by playing games was a new and interesting one. However, the market wasn't quite ready for it yet, and by February 2020, it had dropped below $0.01.</p><p>However, on February 19, 2021, SLP had risen back above $0.01 and reached $0.016. This happened after the first season of the player-versus-player (PVP) arena started. </p><p>It had a steady increase until July 2021 where it peaked at $0.399 and has subsequently been on an extended bearish trend.</p></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><h2><strong>Why Has the Price of SLP Fallen So Much?</strong></h2><p>The recent drop in Axie Infinity’s player base and interest has lowered the value of the in-game resource that drives the game's virtual economy. The <a href=\"https://afkgaming.com/esports/guide/how-to-earn-slp-in-axie-infinity\">SLP token</a> experienced a significant oversupply with users cashing out all their earned SLPs by selling it on cryptocurrency exchanges rather than using it in-game. </p><p>This caused its price to collapse to less than a tenth of its high. At the time of writing, the value of $SLP had also dropped to $0.0034. This was a drop of 99.09 percent from its <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/price/smooth-love-potion/\">peak of $0.399 in July 2021</a>.</p><p>The game has been having trouble keeping its number of daily active users up for a while, and it doesn't look like things are getting better. On June 6, 2022, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g4d2lzBytC-Wo4_rKGHjR3vGeJHb8hd1jb55qRf_S2g/edit#gid=0\">Axie Infinity</a> went from having 2.7 Million active users at its peak to only 517 Thousand at the time of writing.</p></div></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;display:flex;justify-content:center\"><div class=\"o-yqC\"><div class=\"vm-placement\" data-id=\"633a9d7ec672387bad423391\"></div></div></div><div class=\"story-element story-element-text\"><div><p>With the value of the AXS token also significantly dropping, these sound like troubling times for the developers at Sky Mavis. At its peak in November 2021, one <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/price/axie-infinity/\">AXS token</a> was worth $164.90, but it is now only worth $12.65 at the time of writing, dropping by 12.91% in the last 24 hours.</p></div></div><hr class=\"line-break-blockchaingames\">",
